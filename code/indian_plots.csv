When Shiva beats two of Indiran's henchmen who attacked a man for not being able to pay commission, Indiran tells Shiva that he runs that area and his laws apply. Shiva and Indiran's fight is stopped by Manikam, who requests Indiran to beat him and spare Shiva. Manikam is tied to a pole and severely beaten by Indiran, but bears it for the sake of his brother without retaliating. 
Later, Shiva again takes action against Indiran by submitting an arrest warrant which makes him furious again.

Manickam and his friend Anwar Baasha were protesting against the ridiculous behaviors of Antony's men, which prompted Antony to kill Anwar; Manikam was spared as he is Rangasamy's son. Enraged, Manikam decided to take the same path to destroy Antony and had killed Antony's hitmen to avenge Anwar's death. 
Manikam received the support of local people in Bombay who feared for Antony, where he transformed himself into a gangster named Manick Baashha and had frequently interfered in Antony's illegal activities which created enmity between the two. Baashha's command over the city had increased, where Antony decided to kill Baashha, but Baashha escaped from Antony's plan. Enraged, Antony killed Rangasamy, prompting Baashha to help the police arrest Antony while Kesavan (who was Antony's henchman) killed Antony's family and inherited his business and wealth. Before dying, Rangasamy requested Baashha to return to Madras and start a peaceful life. Baashha assented, faked his death and secretly left to Madras along with Vijayalakshmi. 
After remembering his past, Manikam learns that Kesavan has arranged Priya's wedding against her wishes, where he arrives to the wedding hall to stop him. Kesavan is shocked to see Baashha alive in the form of Manikam. Frightened, he permits Priya to go along with Manikam. On learning that Baashha is alive, Antony escapes from prison, kills Kesavan for betraying him, and also kidnaps Manikam's family members, where he threatens Manikam to surrender failing which his family members will be killed. Manikam rushes to the spot, fights Antony and his gang and also saves his family. He nearly kills Antony, but is stopped by Dinakar. Antony then steals Dinakar's gun and tries to shoot Manikam, but is shot dead by Shiva from behind."

Both of them decide to exchange their lives for a month, which would expose them to experience the lifestyle that they have been craving for, after which Goutham would be introduced to the world as the sole heir of his father's wealth. They spend a night in a hotel learning about each other and fitting into each other’s shoes to begin their new lives.
Goutham starts rough, but with some words from Nanda's father for not taking up a job and returning home but living with Nanda's family, he experiences all the emotions that he has been longing for and helps them by being a better son than Nanda could ever be. On the other hand, Nanda has the perfect beginning, except for a few questions from his staff. Goutham starts to fall for Spoorthi and Nanda for Mugdha. Meanwhile, Mudra and Goutham's CSO Gowda plan to kill Goutham. After a failed attempt to kill Nanda (who they think is Goutham), they realize that Goutham had switched places with Nanda and plan to finish him off in Hyderabad. They make several attempts at killing Goutham, though they fail. Goutham realizes that even Nanda is trying to kill him when he found out an imprint of one of his exercise shoes on the mud, even though his family (Nanda’s) is collateral damage. When confronted about the same, Nanda confesses that he did all this for money and so he had joined hands with Mudra and Gowda when he found out that the duo was trying to kill him.
Soon, Nanda frames Goutham by publicly murdering their slum corporator's son Bujji, but Goutham escapes the cops and confronts Nanda in the presence of his family (Goutham’s), who were manipulated by Nanda (whom they think is Goutham). They fail to recognize that Nanda is in Goutham’s place, and they hand Goutham over to the cops. Goutham escapes the cops with the help of Mugdha, who knows that he is Goutham. They arrive at the spot where Spoorthi has been held hostage by Nanda, who also kills Mudra. A fight breaks out between Goutham, Nanda, and Gowda which leads to the death of Gowda followed by another fight on the chopper in which Nanda ends up dead by falling off. Later, Goutham is introduced as the legal heir to his father’s wealth but he announces his venturing towards the path of humanity and donates the entire wealth to a charity, and when asked for an autograph he signs Goutham Nanda. Mugdha is made the CEO of his father's company, and he shares his life with Nanda's parents and Spoorthi. The film ends with Gautama Buddha's saying Greed for money is the root of all evil."
127,Gunda (1998 film),"The film opens with a scene where two corrupt politicians hire two different crime lords viz. Lambu Aatta and Bulla to kill each other. Lambu Aatta kills one of the accomplices of Bulla and initiates the war, later Bulla settles the score by killing Lambu Aatta's brother. Lambu Aatta bounces back by raping and subsequently killing Bulla's sister. Bulla is ultimately able to kill Lambu Aatta and win the war. Now the undisputed leader of the underworld, Bulla is hired by a corrupt politician Bachubhai Bhigona (Deepak Shirke) to murder his rival. Bulla sends his right-hand man Kala Shetty (Rami Reddy) to do the job. Shetty successfully commits the murder in front of several gawking policemen, but as soon as he is able to outrun the police he is caught and turned over to the authorities by Shankar (Mithun Chakraborty). Here we are introduced to the protagonist who works as a coolie in a shipyard, and sometimes at the airport. He lives in relative comfort with his policeman father, his sister, Geeta, and a pet monkey called Tinchu. Shankar also has a girlfriend named Ganga, who wants to marry him as soon as possible, but Shankar has bigger things to worry about.
Shankar further enrages Bulla by entering a fighting competition organized by Bulla at the shipyard. Shankar does not enter to win money or fame for himself, but only to win the money so that some other labourer can marry off his daughter. He manages to defeat Bulla's prize fighter, by just twisting his hand for few seconds! The animosity is raised further when Shankar's father is beaten up by Bulla's goons when his father tries to stop the goons from collecting money from shopkeepers. Shankar reaches the scene and beats Bulla's men, who are able to somersault many feet high in air while fighting. However, Shankar beats all of them with relative ease, though during the fight, it is rather clear that Bulla's men were performing stunts deliberately, and came to the venue only to be thrashed by Shankar.
As revenge, one of Bulla's henchmen, Natte (shortie), abducts Shankar's sister, and tries to molest her. However, she is saved by Gulshan, and she falls in love with Gulshan. But, this turns out to be a scheme by Bulla, as Gulshan marries Geeta and then hands her over to Chuttiya for his pleasure. Bulla gives Chuttiya 'Vitamin Sex' (a likely reference to Viagra), obtained from London, for him to overcome his impotency. However, Geeta dies while being raped by Chuttiya, and he disposes of the body in a jungle. Shankar's monkey, Tinchu sees this and leads Shankar to Bulla's bungalow. Shankar chases Chuttiya to Bulla's doorstep, where he is confronted by Bulla and his henchmen Ibu Hatela (Harish Patel), Pote (Mohan Joshi) and Inspector Kale. Shankar swears revenge on them and then goes his way.
When he learns of his daughter's death, Shankar's father goes mad with grief and threatens Inspector Kale who he blames for being a henchman for Bulla the gangster. After a brief struggle the inspector chokes the old man to death. Shankar meets Bulla and his henchmen and promises them that he will kill all of them in 10 days. On his way back, Shankar finds an abandoned baby girl child, and adopts despite his condition.
Shankar then goes on a rampage and starts killing all of Bulla's accomplices one by one, starting with Gulshan. Shankar finds Ibu Hatela attempting to rape a girl, and beheads him, too. However, when he tries to assassinate the politician Bachubhai Bhigona, a sniper from another car kills Bhigona. Shankar is caught and charged for the murder, and is sentenced to a life term in prison. Shankar escapes prison the same night, and goes after Inspector Kale. Shankar is then ambushed by several Kung-fu trained goons with knives, submachine guns and grenades. Shankar thrashes them and kills Kale.
After this, Shankar goes after Chikna, who is employed by Bulla to lure village girls to the city and then force them into prostitution. Before killing Chikna, Shankar learns that the baby girl he adopted was in fact Bulla's illegitimate child.
While Shankar hunts for Pote, Chuttiya and Bulla on the other hand kill his girlfriend Ganga. After killing Pote, Shankar goes to kill Chuttiya. Chuttiya then informs Shankar that he is impotent and it was his elder brother Bulla who gave him vitamin sex which put him into a frenzy and made him violently rape Shankar's sister. Thus, to take revenge, Shankar castrates Chuttiya and says that this is what he deserves.
In the climactic scene, Bulla and Shankar have a showdown in the shipyard-airport complex. Bulla is backed up by several dozen auto-rickshaws that run helter-skelter and attack Shankar. Shankar takes out a rocket-propelled grenade launcher from the boot of his car and takes down the auto-rickshaws.
The action quickly switches to a coal mine, where Bulla tries to use the adopted baby which he thinks is Shankar's daughter to gain leverage in the fight. Soon Bulla realizes that the baby is his own, he still uses the baby as a shield. Shankar rescues the girl with the help of his monkey, Tinchu. Again the scene switches to airport where Kala Shetty comes with a helicopter to save Bulla. With a brief fight Shankar kills Kala Shetty and finally Bulla."

162,Jallikattu (2019 film),"Kalan Varkey is a butcher in a small, rural village in Kerala, who along with his assistant Antony, meet before dawn each day to slaughter a buffalo and prepare its meat for sale in the market. One morning, a buffalo slips its bindings before Varkey can kill it, escaping into the hilly forest. Soon after, a large haystack is set ablaze, and the entire village wakes up to put out the fire. The men of the village, hearing of the buffalo's escape and believing that it was responsible, begin an urgent hunt for the animal.
As the day progresses, the villagers repeatedly try, but fail to corner the buffalo and kill it. Crops at the rubber plantation are trampled, a drinks vendor's cart is smashed, along with the village's bank and convenience store are both destroyed. The villagers begin to turn on Varkey, blaming him for the vandalism caused by the bull. Meanwhile, the police turn up but refuse to help, as killing cattle is illegal - instead, they focus on merely warning people to stay inside until the buffalo is caught. The frustrated villagers instead call Kuttachan, a renowned local poacher with his own hunting rifle, for help. Antony is unhappy to see Kuttachan back in the village; in a flashback it is revealed that, before Antony married his wife Sophie, the two men had been rivals over her. Antony had won by informing the police that Kuttachan was stealing sandalwood from the local church, leading to his arrest. As Kuttachan prepares for the hunt by chopping up a metal bucket handle into pieces of buckshot, they start a mass argument among the villagers over which man deserves to land the killing blow on the buffalo.
Elsewhere in the village, the disruption - both from the buffalo's rampage and the hunt - spreads further, causing other personal issues to come to the surface. Law and order begins to break down, with some of the men setting off fireworks and committing random acts of vandalism. Kuriachan, a wealthy man who had been planning an elaborate feast of different buffalo dishes for his daughter's wedding party, ventures out to try and find some chicken instead; a group of workers seize him, stripping him and bring him to the hunt as a trophy. Meanwhile, Kuriachan's daughter tries to avoid the arranged marriage by running away - but a neighbour catches and punishes her. Several of the men, enraged and frustrated, beat their wives or drink heavily, while some women find men openly leering at them through windows as they sleep.
After night falls, the buffalo is found lying at the bottom of a well; Antony immediately decided to take the credit, claiming that chasing the buffalo down into the well had been his plan all along. Kuttachan wants to shoot the buffalo there and then, but Antony demands that they bring it back to the surface first so he and Varkey can still butcher it properly and sell the meat. By contrast, Varkey is indifferent, and he takes a nap under a nearby tree as the other men argue and plan. The men construct a scaffold, and lower Antony down so he can attach ropes around the buffalo's legs and neck. However, it begins raining heavily; the ropes slip off as soon as the buffalo reaches the top, and as it thrashes around one of the villagers is thrown down the well and killed. The buffalo escapes again into the forest. Kuttachan and the other villagers blame Antony for the man's death. Meanwhile, another group of men, furious that a cop is still refusing to help, set his car on fire.
By this point the villagers are desperate and frantic. In-fighting leads to them splintering into smaller groups, each with its own plan - and with each man desperate to be the one to finally kill the bull. As the men string up ropes, chains, and nets around the perimeter of the village, forcing the buffalo into a smaller and smaller area, the situation becomes increasingly chaotic and confused. Antony and Kuttachan stumble across each other in a clearing in the dark forest, and begin fighting; Kuttachan is about to kill Antony, but the buffalo suddenly emerges from the undergrowth and disrupts the fight. Kuttachan catches the buffalo by its horns and asks Antony to hold its legs. But Antony uses this opportunity to stab Kuttachan multiple times and fatally wounds him. The buffalo escapes. Antony and the villagers chase the buffalo towards the river and across a bridge, where the animal becomes stuck in deep mud.
Antony stabs the buffalo, and screams that he was the one who deserves the credit for killing it. This kicks off a desperate pile-on, as dozens of men, holding lit torches and bearing crude weapons, jump on top of each other, stabbing both the animal and each other as they form a huge, writhing mass of human bodies. The final shot is of a group of prehistoric men, wearing loincloths and carrying spears, racing each other through the dark while hunting a buffalo."

His upbringing gives him strong moral values, but when he leaves his home, his beliefs are challenged by the corrupt social system. Unsettled by this, Aravind decides to fight immorality by taking on corrupt bureaucrats.
People he becomes close with - his friend Suresh (Vennela Kishore), the lawyer Rajasekhar (Subbu Panchu), the journalist Gopi (Siva Balaji), and his girlfriend Indumathi (Amala Paul) - join him on his mission to fight corruption. They create a fake persona, Harish Chandra, based on a modified picture of Aravind, and use this to trick government officials into accepting bribes. They then successfully expose 147 officials, including Indumathi's father (Ahuti Prasad), a court judge, and an MP (Tanikella Bharani).
All of the exposed officials team up, led by the MP, the judge, and Sathenapalli Savithri (Rethika Srinivas), an IAS officer, to take on Aravind and his team. They plan to use a look-alike, who fits the image and description of Harish. The look-alike is named Maya Kannan, a 42-year-old middle-aged man who does underground work for the Tamil Nadu government. He is implied to be a womanizer. The officials attempt to show that Harish is indeed a real person, in order to thwart Aravind's plan.
Maya Kannan, in Tamil Nadu, accepts the deal with the government officials on the condition of receiving 14.7 crores from the corrupt officials.
After learning of this plot from an employee of a government hospital, Pune (Dhanraj), also employed by the 147 members, Aravind fears that all his efforts will be in vain. He heads to Tamil Nadu to stop Kannan from claiming the made up identity of Harish, leading to a fight between the two. As the case takes place in court, Aravind and his team members are disappointed as Kannan successfully claims the identity of Harish.
Just when the corrupt officials are glad that things are going as planned, there is a plot twist: Kannan explains that he was supporting Aravind from the start!

245,Major (film),"The movie starts with Sandeep Unnikrishnan entering the POK, which the Pakistani Army considers a threat and orders him to retreat. When questioned by the Indian Army Officials on why he did it and that the area belongs to Pakistan, he replies ""It is ours"". Young Sandeep grows up with his sister, Sandhya, and his parents K. Unnikrishnan and Dhanalakshmi, in Yelahanka, Bangalore. As a child, he was very curious about the world around him. When Unnikrishnan took him to see a Navy ceremony with military airplanes flying in the sky Sandeep developed an early fascination with the life of a soldier. In his later years as a secondary school student, Sandeep falls in love with his classmate, Isha. Sandeep applied to join the Indian Navy without telling his parents, much to the fury of Unnikrishnan. However, the Navy ultimately rejected Sandeep's application, causing Sandeep to ultimately join the army. As the years progressed Sandeep rose up the ranks to become an NSG training officer.
In 2008, Sandeep is well established in his career as a training officer for the 51 Special Action Group of the NSG and is married to Isha, but their marriage is in trouble. Sandeep asks for leave to try and save his marriage. On the same day as Sandeep's leave though, Pakistani terrorists arrive in Mumbai by boat and they proceed to orchestrate deadly attacks in the city. Desperately crowds start heading to the Taj Hotel for safety but the terrorists also enter the hotel and start shooting at staff and guests indiscriminately. The local police are called to the scene but they are ill-equipped to deal with the threat. Upon discovering the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, Sandeep requests Commander Shera to allow him to participate in the NSG mission to neutralize the terrorist threat. They leave for Mumbai and commence the military counterterrorism operation: Operation Black Tornado, but the NSG encounters a vast number of obstacles and problems upon arriving at the scene. They lack surveillance cameras to discover the number of people inside the building. 
The terrorists have installed deadly booby traps and trip wires with bombs throughout the premises. Several hotel staff and guests end up crowded together in a locked room, all bound and gagged on the floor. To make matters worse there is an intrusive media circus swarming outside the hotel reporting the NSG's known operations and movements, information which ultimately proves useful to the terrorists. Meanwhile, a guest named Pramoda Reddy, who is trapped on the fifth floor, manages to keep herself hidden from the gunmen. She ultimately takes responsibility to rescue British tourist's young daughter, named Shirley. Sandeep talks to Isha over the phone. She is applying for divorce and scolds Sandeep for not being there with her when she had a miscarriage, but she is horrified when she discovers that Sandeep is at the Taj Hotel. As the NSG rescue more hostages (several of whom remain tied up inside a locked banquet hall) and starts closing in on the remaining terrorists, Pramoda calls the downstairs lobby using a walkie-talkie from one of the dead security guards. 
Sandeep ultimately decides to go to the 5th floor to save them, saying that he would never be able to forgive himself if he did not save her. His colleagues subsequently use tear gas and Sandeep races up to the 5th floor. He ultimately rescues Pramoda and Shirley and heroically kills some of the terrorists. However, when his CO asks him whether he needs reinforcement or not, he refuses. His last words are ""Do not come up, I will handle them."" But as fate would have it, he is killed in action, laying down his life for his country. Major Sandeep's parents watch in horror as the news coverage shows that Sandeep was killed in action. They had thought that since Sandeep was a training officer he was not involved in the rescue mission at the Taj Hotel. After his death, there is a large military funeral and a crowd of well-wishers gather to mourn Sandeep's passing. Isha is devastated at Sandeep's death and discovers that he never signed the divorce papers. Later, a 10-year commemoration ceremony in 2018 honoring the lives taken during the attack is held at the Taj Hotel. During the commemorations, Pramoda is reunited with the Shirley whose life she had saved. Mr. Unnikrishnan gives an impassioned speech in which he says that Sandeep should be remembered not for how he died, but for how he lived. 
As Unnikrishnan recalls during his speech, a flashback shows the continuation of the beginning of the movie. It is shown that Sandeep was playing cricket with the children from Pakistan, and when he was called back, he waves goodbye and promises the children that he would come to play another time."

He participates in the Indian National Games and wins the gold medal in the steeplechase event 7 years in a row.

Vijayendra arrives at the house of a former wrestler named Sarkar living in Gajendragarh and learns the story of a young orphan named Krishna whom Sarkar witnessed fighting off a group of boys in exchange for helping other kids get food.

353,Rendu,"Shakti is a young man from a village with no job but much ambition and dreams. As he sees his life pass him by, stuck in a rut in his hometown, he decides that he will try his fortunes elsewhere. Chennai beckons him and off goes Shakti to join his uncle Kirikalan, who has a stall of magic tricks at an exhibition. Kirikalan is not really a magician, but poses as one, and his amateurish tricks don't exactly bring in big crowds.
Next door to Shakti and Kirikalam's stall though, is one ever-populated with visitors. The reason: it is an all-girls stand, with mermaid costumes as the theme. Velli is the 'head mermaid' at this stall run by her sister, and bitter quarrels between her and Shakti ensue, when he feels that she and her team are unfairly taking their customers away, and she has this impression of him being an unsavoury character. This misunderstanding is seen at different occasions where Velli and Shakti just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time — be it when Shakti gets off the bus from his village, asks for directions and is told to follow Velli, walking in the distance (Velli thinks he is a womaniser or when Shakti finally catches up with a miscreant who had picked his pocket and demands his money back — only Velli walks into the scene only at the demanding part. This whole collage of scenes is animated, with Kirikalan and Shakti trying to woo customers back to their stall, Shakti and Velli getting into arguments, and a general state of ""fun"" ruckus. Of course, love has been brewing as an undercurrent between the two young people.
The exhibition grounds owner keeps harassing Velli under some pretext or the other, like the rent not being paid on time. In fact, he has a soft spot for her, feelings thoroughly rejected by her. He finally abducts her, but Shakti rescues her. Similarly, Velli's plight is repeated when her ""mora maapillai"" (betrothed suitor) enters the scene and tries to force her to be with him, and Shakti steps in once again to save and protect Velli. The undercurrents of love blow up into a full-fledged torrent, and Velli and Shakti make up for all of their lost time professing their love for each other and romancing their way happily through the exhibition.
Meanwhile, we see a series of murders in different towns of the state and two perpetrators of these crimes slinking away from each. Not every time is it foolproof though, and at one crime scene, a witness spots the main culprit. He is instructed by the police to sketch and give them a pictorial description of the murderer, when it comes to the police's knowledge that both the criminals have been seen at Kumbakonam some time ago. Going through various fact files, the police come across the incident of a bad fire at a marriage hall in Kumbakonam, and as the officer in charge of the investigation flips through the picture files of the deceased, Kannan's face is shown, and the witness jumps. He tells the police he doesn't need to sketch anything when the face of the main murderer itself is staring them in the eye — he points to the photo of Kannan - it is the face of Shakti, only this one has light eyes. Investigations into the murder lead the police to Chennai. As luck would have it, Shakti is spotted, recognized, and arrested. Kannan, on the other hand, follows the murder investigation and is upset to find that an innocent man has been captured for crimes he has committed. He meets Kirikalan and Velli and plots to help Shakti get out. And so he does, and Shakti and he escape by the skin of their teeth. After much chase-and-hide, Kannan tells the story of what led him to murder all those people.
Kannan, his elder brother, and his father were renowned caterers and were commissioned to cook for a marriage function in Kumbakonam. The host was Kannan's father's friend and this gentleman's daughter Manjula  was going to be married in a joyous ceremony. There, Kannan meets Jyoti and falls in love instantly. At first he panics that Jyoti is the bride at the function but is vastly relieved when he finds out she is not. She really likes Kannan too and it all seems like Wonderland. Unfortunately, the groom's family creates trouble at the wedding and walks out, leaving the family distraught and desperate. Suddenly Kannan makes a suggestion, ""Father, this is our friend's wedding and the bride is a wonderful girl. Why can't Anna (elder brother) marry her?"" A brilliant idea and it is decided - only fate has to fell her axe right then, when all hell breaks loose and a raging fire attacks the marriage house. The father of the bride is a good man, and a dignitary in the town of Kumbakonam. He learns that some powerful thugs and gang leaders have sold a large piece of government property to a north Indian Landlord, completely illegally at exorbitant prices, with no gain for the townspeople themselves. He strongly opposes them and all their mischief comes to public notice and foils their plans. They want his blood as revenge.
They set fire to the building of the wedding and kill every single inmate inside — but two people escape, Kannan and his friend. Kannan, whose light eyes are a result of the fire (he walks with help and not very clear sight) is heartbroken and devastated at the loss of his entire family and lady love at what was to be a joyous, happy occasion. He vows retribution on the villains and sets about cold-bloodedly fulfilling this. Shakti decides to help Kannan achieve his revenge with the help of Velli and Kirikalan. At the end, however, Kannan sacrifices his own life to kill the final baddie, and he reunites with his family and lady love in heaven. Later that, Kannan jumps on Lava and he dies."

355,Return of Hanuman,"Devas are ’busy’ in their Swarglok (heaven). Technology has crossed the boundaries of earth and even non-mortal devas have become techno-geeks. They converse in Hinglish. Meanwhile, a terrific war is being fought between the Devas and the Asuras. In this war, Lord Vishnu slices the demon Rahuketu into two parts through his stomach. His collapse invokes the Guru of Asuras, Guru Shukracharya and he comes forward to battle with Lord Vishnu. He also slices a large snake named Kaladansh into two parts. Lord Vishnu gains an upper hand in the war and throws Shukracharya into space. Shukracharya announces a prophecy throughout the Universe warning Lord Vishnu that the same humans whom he is protecting, in Kali Yuga they will themselves become very cruel than even demons and a day will come when their cruelty will give rise to the greatest demon of the Universe which will engulf the whole humankind. Shukracharya then transforms himself into Planet Shukra or Venus and it becomes the home of demons. Later he joins Rahuketu's sliced body with that of Kaladansh's tail and vice versa. This gives rise to two demons Rahu and Ketu. Shukracharya declares that as long as his Sarpdand i.e. Snake Wand lives, the demons will remain powerful.
Hanuman, who has just returned to heaven after completing his task on earth, is bored. He sees a village boy who is bullied by his classmates. He decides to help him, not as a God or an invisible force but as a human. He then asks Lord Brahma to allow him to take birth as a human being. Brahma allows but keeps some conditions which Hanuman agrees to accept. He appears on earth in a village named Bajrangpur from a priest and his wife as a human baby. What makes the reincarnated Hanuman different from other humans is that he has a tail and a huge appetite. The baby is named ""Maruti"" by his mother. After Maruti is three months old, he takes admission in the same school where the boy he wanted to help studies and befriends with him. Thereafter, he teaches a lesson to his bully classmates, Gabbar Singh and his gang.
Meanwhile, on planet Shukra, there is a fight between Rahu and Ketu and accidentally the Sarpdand comes to Earth. Danavs come to Earth to search for it but they have to face Maruti. Maruti easily defeats Rahu and Ketu with the help of his army of monkeys that came to help him to get free from the hands of culprits (who caught him because he stole the mangoes from his garden). In order to defeat Rahu and Ketu, Narada must remind Maruti that he is actually Hanuman. After Narada and Maruti meet, Maruti is reminded that he can turn to Hanuman as per his will. Maruti then turns to the more powerful Hanuman, with his godly powers. He still has the appearance of a child but looks like child Hanuman, the appearance from the film's predecessor. Then a monster made of polythene and other non-biodegradable waste appears from a volcano that was said to form when Sarpdand merged with the Kamandal thrown by Shukracharya which coincidentally fell into the volcano in Bajrangpur. The monsters keep on swallowing the villagers of Bajrangpur. After struggling to stop the monster, Hanuman asked for help from God Ram. God Ram then said that when a blockage, which is seen in the end, is cleared then the monster (mainly made of plastic and other waste thrown by humans) will finish up. Hanuman did what Ram said, and the monster was defeated. Finally, Hanuman said his farewells to his family and friends and leaves Bajrangpur."

Just then, a group of people come there with the calf and inform them that Munuswamy's brothers have kidnapped the calf's mother (who belongs to the temple) along with many other cows. This leads to Raju Garu beating up Munuswamy's brother and bringing the cows back.
The news of his brothers' humiliation reaches Munuswamy, and he and his three brothers, go to Raju Garu's house, where the celebration is going on. They brutally kill every member of the family, except for Raju Garu's wife, who gets injured. Raju Garu manages to distract the brothers while his wife runs away with the child, but she becomes weak and is unable to continue due to her deep injury. Just then, the calf (whose mother was saved by Raju Garu) comes and stands in front of her. Raju Garu's wife takes this as a sign, wraps the child in a shawl, and ties him onto the calf. The villains come just in time to see the calf running away, and a chase ensues. The injured calf manages to evade the villains and land the baby on a truck carrying soil. The villains see the child falling down the cliff and believe him to be dead. To conceal their crime, they set fire to the cowshed, because in bad times even animals can become a prime witness to their sins.
The story then goes into a narration where the narrator explains that even though Munuswamy is happy that he has destroyed every witness to his crime, he has forgotten that the five elements of nature that are present everywhere have witnessed his crimes and will surely take their revenge for his atrocities.
Meanwhile, the child is carried to a soil mine, where the truck dumps him along with the soil. A Hindu saint sees the child, takes him to Kasi, and leaves him in Temple. A childless couple, Siva Prasad and his wife are there to pray for a child and are overwhelmed to see him. Then the temple priest names him Viswa because this is nature's order to rise the child by them. Later the couple leaves for the US with the child.

Viswa and his friends are introduced. They are in the process of developing a new video game, which they are sending to a company to be released.
Unfortunately, their video gets rejected due to the lack of cultural factors. Viswa and his friend run into a girl named Soundarya Lahari, a Hindu Spiritual Preacher who came to the USA to preach Indian mythology. Viswa is instantly smitten, so he and his friend follow her to get her help in developing the game with cultural elements. However, Soundarya is offended by their offer of money and says flatly that culture is not something to be sold. Viswa and his friend help Soundarya's sister and brother-in-law to secure jobs, using his influence, which leads to Soundarya reluctantly agreeing to help Viswa.
She introduces the group to Valmiki her childhood friend an IT professional who has an ardent knowledge of Indian Mythology, who helps by giving them a unique idea for a game that resembles Viswa's life story - about a boy whose entire family was killed by villains and the five elements of nature taking revenge on the villains through the boy. Vishwa was impressed with the concept of Valmiki and hired him to develop his game.
Meanwhile, Soundarya leaves for India to see her father Tagore, who was bedridden by Munuswamy's gang for fighting against them in court. Viswa follows her to India and starts developing the video game there.
Meanwhile, Munuswamy ordered to kill Soundarya because as a warning to stop Tagore on his way. Later in a couple of situations, Soundarya was saved by Vishwa from Veeraswamy, Munuswamy's 1st brother, and eventually, killed by him through the air and earth elements in nature. He was shell-shocked when he discovers the story of the video game happening in his real life. When he came to Kasi to give salutations from his mother's side to Kasi Vishwanath temple there he accidentally meets 2nd brother of Munuswamy he was killed through him by the element of fire. He tries his best to stop it, but in vain. Meanwhile, Munuswamy is in the search of his brother's killer.
Soundarya accepts Viswa's love for his efforts to save her from Munuswamy's brother and agrees to marry him. Meanwhile, Valmiki designs a full game and comes back to India and meets his grandfather practicing Vedic astrology who is looking at the bad omens of Munuswamy and his brothers and also fixing the marriage dates of Vishwa and Soundarya.
After hearing Valmiki's game concept he understands that this is an act of vengeance on Munuswamy and his brothers by the Almighty of Mother Nature because of their sins committed against Vishwa's biological parents. He remembers Valmiki that in his childhood in front of young Valmiki, Youth Munuswamy and his brothers criticizes the astrologer and denies god to leave on their terms. He reveals to Valmiki that this screenplay was written by mother nature through him, she witnessed all the incidents and selected him to design the situations and it cannot be stopped by anyone. Meanwhile, Viswa's business rival, Shakti join hands with Munuswamy for taking over his major stakes in India and abducts them, then he threatens Vishwa to give them the shares documents.

395,Sethupathi IPS,"Terrorism against India is escalated heavily by Indians trained abroad. Sethupathi IPS (Vijayakanth) is a very efficient cop whose entire family has served the country at some time — his mother Satyabhama (Srividya) is an IAS Officer, his maternal grandfather was a soldier who got a medal for killing 200 enemies (a medal which Sethupathi secretly covets), and his father in law (Vijayakumar) is an Inspector General of Police.
Sethupathi catches terrorist Sivasubramaniam in a hospital and coaxes him to reveal information that their gang is planning a terrorist strike on the Prime minister of India during his meeting with Chief Ministers of various states in Chennai. After divulging this information (owing to the kindness and pity shown by Sethupathi), the terrorist commits suicide with Sethupathi's gun. Using the information, Sethupathi is able to save the day and the Prime minister.
Sivasubramaniam's death leads to his brother Sivaprakasham (Raj Mohan) arriving in India. Sivaprakasham is also the leader of this terrorist gang, and in addition to the terror strike the gang is planning to launch in India, he also plans to wipe out Sethupathi's family.
Moving opposite to Sethupathi's house, Sivaprakasam pretends to be a very nice man ""Satyaprakasham"" and manages to fool Sethupathi's mother, wife (Meena), sister, and grandfather and convinces all of them of his true intentions to such an extent that they agree to his engagement with their mute daughter Saraswathi. Sivaprakasam avoids Sethupathi and sees to it that during both the engagement and the wedding, Sethupathi is occupied so that he cannot come face to face with Sivaprakasam.
After the wedding, the Terrorists take over a school where Sethupathi's wife (Meena) is a teacher and demands for a plane and money to take them abroad. Sivaprakasam brings his wife (Sethupathi's sister) and watches her get gang raped until Sethupathi's wife shoots her, unable to bear her suffering. Sivaprakasam also shoots a boy student of class v.
As the terrorists escape the school towards the plane and take off, Sethupathi has arrived after having killed one of their numbers, and disguising himself, he eliminates all of them, including Sivaprakasam and lands the plane safely (on instructions of the injured pilot).
The movie ends with Sethupathi receiving his coveted grandfather's medal."

397,Shaan (1980 film),"Deputy Commissioner of Police Shiv Kumarr (Sunil Dutt) returns home to his wife Sheetal (Rakhee Gulzar) and their young daughter, announcing that he has been transferred to Bombay. He has two brothers Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) and Ravi (Shashi Kapoor) who live in Bombay. They are intelligent, capable guys, but spend their time loafing about the city and conning unsuspecting people. However, a mysterious man (Shatrughan Sinha) tries to assassinate Shiv twice in the city, but Shiv survives both times.
After being swindled by Chacha (Johnny Walker) and Renu (Bindiya Goswami), Vijay and Ravi decide to join forces with them along with a glamorous thief named Sunita (Parveen Babi). One of their tricks eventually backfires and lands Vijay and Ravi in jail. However, Shiv bails them out and reads them the riot act at home, hoping to shape them into a much honorable life. After hearing about the two attempts on Shiv's life, Vijay and Ravi try to advise him to find a different line of work, arguing that his profession is unpredictable, dangerous and unsuitable for a family man. However, Shiv stands firm by citing his undying patriotic commitment to his corps and his country.
It eventually turns that the mysterious man works for a sadistic international crime lord named Shakaal (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), who is operating from a remote island outside India while funding crime in Bombay and rejoicing in pain of his enemies and traitors. Due to the fact that Shiv is getting closer to finding out the root of the criminal acts in Bombay, Shakaal has Shiv brought to the island, where he kills Shiv on the beach from a helicopter and has his body dumped back to Bombay.
As Vijay, Ravi and Sheetal lament their tragic loss of Shiv, the mysterious man shows up, introducing himself as Rakesh, a marksman and former circus performer who used to shoot targets blindfolded. Rakesh confessed that he was blackmailed to work for Shakaal, who held Rakesh's wife hostage, and that he deliberately missed on the two previous occasions in hopes of buying time to rescue his wife. However, Shakaal already had deduced this and arranged Rakesh's wife to be killed in a car accident in retaliation. Upon learning this, Vijay and Ravi allied with Rakesh in hopes of killing Shakaal in revenge for their loved ones. To that end, the trio seek the aid of a homeless cripple Abdul (Mazhar Khan), who provided them information about Shakaal's contraband warehouse in Bombay. Though the trio manage to destroy the warehouse, Shakaal retaliates by having his men to murder Abdul and kidnap Sheetal.
Though it would've appeared that the trio are about to concede defeat over Sheetal's imminent fate, one of Shakaal's aides named Jagmohan (Mac Mohan) arrives to them and offers his help to gain entry to Shakaal's hideout, as he was brutally crippled by Shakaal for his previous failure. Posing as a musical troupe, the trio (along with Renu, Chacha and Sunita) enter the island and perform for Shakaal, but the latter captures them, revealing that he actually sent Jagmohan (who was faking his injuries) to trap them. However, Chacha causes a commotion that allows the trio to escape and kill Jagmohan and the rest of Shakaal's men.
Just as the trio finally managed to trap Shakaal and are about to kill him, Sheetal refuses to let them, pointing out that doing so would be disrespectful to the law that Shiv upholds. The arguing commotion allows Shakaal to free himself, forcing the trio to fatally shoot him down in self-defense. However, Shakaal sets the island to self-destruct before he dies. Despite this, the trio and their loved ones escape on a helicopter to safety, satisfied that they have beaten Shakaal in his tracks for good."
398,Shabri,"The film starts with accidental death of Kisnya (younger brother of the villain), who insists that Shabri be handed over to Police for the murder of Inspector Khare, which Murad ( a friendly neighbor of Shabri family who is a bookie)  forcefully opposes. Shabri is guilty of murder of a wicked police inspector (Khare) who tried to rape her in police station in front of her younger brother who has already been tortured by Khare.

There is a shoot out. Murad gets shot and is captured by the gang (he is later put to death with two dozen bullets by an angry Rajdhar Bhau, who wants to avenge Kisnya's death). Shabri is taken to Kadam's flat where the drunk officer tries to rape her but Shabri again somehow manages to run away after shooting Kadam in foot and breaking a bottle of beer on his head.
Now another friend of the late Murad namely Vilas helps her. Here an interesting character, Irfan Kazi (played by Zakir Hussain) enters the story, interesting because it is not possible to make out if he is good or evil. Nevertheless, he is an encounter cop who is fed up with killing criminals and wishes to do something more creative for his own entertainment. He does this by giving Shabri inside knowhow of Rajdar Bhau's gang where unknown to the egotist Rajdar almost every one, by now fed up with selfishness of their boss, is standing on brink of rebellion.

Each gangster standing around them are now friends of Shabri and ready to kill Rajdar at her signal - their guns are pointed at Rajdar bhau (using her leadership qualities and Kazi's contacts she has convinced all of them that their future and well being is now in getting rid of Rajdar bhau and reorganizing under Shabri's being their chief under whom they will all work as equal partners ). Rajdar Bhau, with Shabri's approval shoots himself."
399,Shahenshah (1988 film),"A corrupt and sniveling bank manager Mathur (Prem Chopra) has illegally borrowed 2.5 million rupees and loaned them to crime baron J.K. Verma (Amrish Puri). J.K orchestrates a bank robbery to bail him out. Inspector Anand Shrivastav (Kader Khan) gets wind of this plot. He is about to crack the case when J.K. enlists an exotic dancer, Julie (Aruna Irani), to use the robbery as a backdrop and frame the honest inspector for corruption. Inspector Shrivastav is arrested by the CBI and is imprisoned for three months. Inspector Shrivastav, the honest and innocent inspector, is so depressed about the false charges that he hangs himself at home after being released on bail. This creates a lasting and powerful impression on his young eight-year-old son, Vijaykumar. Vijay retains the noose his father used to hang himself. He vows someday restore his father's honour. Vijay and his mother leave their house and live in the house of another honest police inspector named Aslam Khan.
Years later, a young Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) in the inspector uniform,  grows up in the care of Inspector Aslam Khan (Pran), Inspector Shrivastav's friend and partner, who has allowed Vijay and his mother to live with him, and Vijay becomes a cop himself. Vijay is friends with Shaheena, the daughter of Aslam Khan. Aslam Khan is an honest cop much like Vijay's father. Vijay is an obsequious and cowardly inspector, prone to bribery and generally scared of powerful criminals. It doesn't take JK long to find Vijay, get him on the payroll, and run his underworld crime empire (drugs, guns, racketeering) past the cops.
A new apparition bursts upon this scene who calls himself ""Shahenshah"", a costumed crime fighter (see movie poster). He has a left iron hand which is used to attack enemies and smash objects, and Shahenshah's other weapon is a noose. Oddly enough, it is the same noose Vijay's father used to hang himself with. This is because it is revealed later that Shahenshah is actually Vijay. When wearing Shahenshah's attire, Vijay describes himself as ""one who doesn't hold a cop's job but does the same work; one who apprehends criminals himself, conducts the trials himself, and, pronounces and executes the sentences himself"". So Vijay/Shahenshah's outward mission is to take out crime, but his real goal is to get to the guys who framed his father.
Shahenshah quietly breaks up several of J.K.'s gambling dens and illicit liquor distilleries. He also halts the demolition of a slum. This catches the eye of small-time trickster Shalu (Meenakshi Seshadri) who lives there with her aging and ailing mother Julie. J.K. had ordered her assassination after she helped frame Vijay's father; she has been on the run from him ever since, which becomes Shalu's motivation for seeking out and eliminating J.K. Shalu decides to infiltrate J.K.'s coterie by becoming an exotic dancer. One night, she attempts to kill J.K. by shooting him but is shocked when J.K. reveals he had been wearing a bullet-proof vest the whole time. Vijay lies to J.K. that Shahenshah's weakness is not letting Shalu die. He also lies that if J.K. returns Shalu to Shahenshah, Shahenshah will return J. K.'s goods worth millions. But J.K. is ultimately fooled. Shahenshah later detonates a bomb planted in J.K.'s truck.
J.K. murders an honest crime reporter Mohammed Salim (Vijayendra Ghatge), who was about to expose J.K.'s crime ring. Salim was married to Shaheena (Supriya Pathak), the daughter of Aslam Khan. Vijay now decides to turn around his image as a cowardly cop. He openly defies J.K. Julie agrees to testify against J.K. Shalu provides ancillary evidence. And J.K. prepares for an all out war against Shahenshah/Vijay, Shalu and the lot of his enemies. At Salim's funeral, only one of the many witnesses of his death were present. He was about to reveal J.K.'s name, but a sharpshooter shoots him to death.
There is a veritable bloodbath on the streets as Inspector Vijay tries to get Julie into the courthouse. And there is a final showdown where Shahenshah reveals his secret identity and becomes the nemesis for all the culprits. To give himself a chance to escape, J.K. abducts Shalu. The showdown leads Shahenshah chasing J.K. to the roof of the courthouse where J.K. is pleading his case, because his cover is blown. J.K. falls through a hole in the roof and is clinging on for dear life, with the whole court looking in astonishment. Shahenshah then reveals before the whole court that he is actually Vijay. Vijay throws the noose down to J.K., and he gratefully accepts it, but J.K., being the ruthless man that he is, attempts to attack Vijay. Vijay lets go of the noose, which slips around J.K.'s neck, and before the whole court, J.K. Verma is hanged, avenging Inspector Shrivastav and Salim the reporter, Shaheena's husband."

Then, on eve of Akhil’s wedding, Gauri is slain by an unidentified. The cataclysmic forms severe impact on Daya. Yet, he is committed and initiates an inquiry which is hindered by Sivalinga Prasad. Thus, Daya resigns and wipes out Chota’s gang. Forthwith, Sivalinga Prasad announces shoot-at-sight orders against Daya and assigns Salim who ensnares him. On the verge of his, encounter Akhil fires on Salim and frees Daya. Afterward, Daya knocks out Sivalinga Prasad too. 
Now Daya calls for Bilal to fuse him which he accepts and succeeds in getting him out of India. Later that night, Daya & Bilal begin a dialogue when Bilal states Ashok as the homicide of Gauri. Here shockingly, Daya proclaims that Ashok has been encountered before Gauri’s death. Notoriously, it is Bilal’s foul play that killed Gauri on behalf of Ashok inducing Daya against Chota’s gang. Anyhow, Daya has made this reverse artifice for it. He slaughters Bilal therein and returns. At last, with the backing of Gurunarayana Daya’s crimes are posed as a covert mission and he is reinstated. Finally, the movie ends with Daya persistently proceeding to a new operation along with his team."

415,Simmba,"Sangram ""Simmba"" Bhalerao is an antiheroic orphan from Shivgarh, the same town where Bajirao Singham was raised, where he observes how policemen make money in the form of bribes, finding himself motivated to become a police officer, and succeeds. Getting bribes from some local thieves and a jeweller, Simmba enjoys and takes full advantage of the lifestyle of a corrupt cop.
Simmba is soon transferred to the Miramar police station in Goa by Home Minister Vinayak Dutta, where he sees Shagun Sathe and falls in love with her at first sight. He meets his fellow policemen and one of his juniors, Nityanand Mohile, who is an honest constable, hesitates to salute Simmba as he's a corrupt cop. To prove his worth in Miramar, he interrupts a pub party run by a influential gangster named Durva Yashwant Ranade's brothers, Sadashiv ""Sada"" Ranade and Gaurav ""Giri"" Ranade and demands more money from them, whilst promising that he will let them continue with their illegal activities. 
Durva agrees and uses Simmba to free the land of an old person named Vaman Rao, who is forced to sign the papers by Simmba. Meanwhile, Simmba develops motherly and sisterly bonds with several women and girls, one of whom happens to be Aakruti Dave, a young woman who reminds Simmba of his teacher. Aakruti files a complaint against Sada and Giri for dealing illicit drugs in their pub and using children as peddlers. Simmba initially ignores this after being pacified by Durva, and Shagun, in the meantime, falls in love with him. 
Meanwhile, Aakruti learns about the drug racket in the club and goes there one night with Chhotu, a mute boy who's her student. She videotapes everything there by her cell phone to show evidence to the police but is caught by Sada and Giri. Chhotu discreetly records Sada and Giri assaulting Aakruti and flees once both of them realize. Aakruti is brutally killed by Sada and Giri. Chhotu tries to tell Aakruti's friend Kavya about Aakruti being in danger. Kavya whilst being chased by Durva's goons goes to Simmba to file Aakruti's missing complaint. 
Aakruti is found injured in hospital. Simmba tries to talk to her, but she dies, leaving him devastated. The police recover Aakruti's phone and the video which she shot, and Durva sends his goons to get the phone from Simmba, who is present, mends his ways, and fights them all. Simmba finally wears his police uniform, and seeing this change in him, Mohile finally salutes him as they arrest Sada and Giri. He apologises to Vaman Rao and returns the land swindled from him. 
In the court, Simmba is shocked to find Aakruti's video being deleted. He beats up Durva's friend, Corporator David Cameron, who gave a false statement in the court, leading to his suspension orders. He decides to kill Sada and Giri before he goes, and plans to show it as an encounter. He shoots them both and shows as if he killed them in the act of self-defence. An SIT committee is set up by the state, who question Simmba's encounter. Aiming to achieve clarity to the situation, Vinayak appoints a neutral officer to handle Aakruti's case, as well as Simmba's controversial encounter.

He also calls Durva's mother Bharti and wife Varsha, who each state that it was Sada and Giri who assaulted Aakruti and that the brothers ran a drug racket and several other illegal activities. 
As a result of these crimes, Durva is sentenced to 7 years of rigorous imprisonment by the court. Singham reveals that he helped Simmba despite being against his corrupt actions so that he could instil a fear of law in the minds of men who do not respect women. When Singham leaves Miramar Police Station, he chats with DCP Veer Sooryavanshi on the phone. and also congratulates him on his new post as the ATS chief.

He resolves most of the problems in his village with non-violence and mutual counselling. He uses force only when the situation demands it, thereby gaining much reputation and love from the villagers.

Singam initially thinks of Kavya as a tiger when she is about to prank her cousin by wearing a tiger costume. As Singam is roaming around the village, he accidentally slaps her. As Kavya is about to take revenge on Singam, he apologizes to her. Kavya gets moved by this and slowly falls in love with him. After some hilarious incidents, Kavya professes her love to Singam.

Humiliated, Mayil reaches Nallur but is unable to take any revenge on Singam, fearing the immense love and devotion of the entire village towards Singam. Using political contacts, Mayil Vaaganam gets Singam transferred to Chennai to teach him a lesson. Singam, unaware of Mayil's hand behind his transfer, joins Thiruvanmiyur police station. His coworker SI Ravi hates Mayil for his crimes, but is unable to take any action because of Mayil's political powers. Rajendran, Singam's senior is on Mayil's payroll and takes care in concealing and eliminating the evidence of Mayil's crimes from the eyes of the law.
The Commissioner also does not help Singam as there is no evidence against Mayil, and Rajendran warns Singam to stay away from Mayil's case.

425,Sivaji: The Boss,"Sivaji Arumugam is a rich Indian software engineer, who returns to India after working for 10 years in the United States. He aims to establish a non-profit trust called Sivaji Foundation, which is to include a network of quality hospitals and educational institutions that serve the poor free of charge. A highly influential political leader and industrialist, Adiseshan, who runs profit-making educational institutions and hospitals sees Sivaji as his deadly competitor.
In the process of establishing the Sivaji Foundation, Sivaji is forced to pay bribes to several government officials and ministers to get basic approvals and sanctions done, and is eventually forced to mortgage his property and sell his belongings when the bribes demanded become very high. Sivaji is dragged by the State Government (under political influence of Adiseshan) to court when he starts sabotaging the Sivaji Foundation through his political influence, but at the court, he is forced to admit that he paid numerous bribes. The judge declares the verdict in favour of Adiseshan and shuts down Sivaji Foundation. Meanwhile, Sivaji falls in love with Tamizhselvi, a demure and traditional girl. Initially, Tamizhselvi and her family are scared of Sivaji's advances, but Sivaji soon manages to win Tamizhselvi's heart and her family's approval. However, when an astrologer checks Sivaji's and Tamizhselvi's horoscopes, he warns that their engagement will result in heavy financial ruin and further, their union will result in Sivaji's death.
Tamizhselvi initially refuses the proposal due to her concern for Sivaji, but he calms her fears and convinces her to marry him. Sivaji, reduced to utter poverty, decides to play the game his own way. With the help of his uncle Arivu, he acquires evidence of ₹2 billion worth of illegal earnings in Adiseshan's possession and uses the documents to blackmail Adiseshan into giving him half the money. Adhiseshan traps Sivaji with 50 goons, but Sivaji trashes them and leaves with both money and documents. Using the amount, he further obtains details on people who have illegal earnings across Tamil Nadu and blackmails them to give him half of their illegal wealth. He then transfers the money to New York, where he gives it to the bank accounts of his friends around the world by hawala forgery. They then deposit the money as donations to the Sivaji Foundation, making the money usable and legitimate.
Sivaji informs the Income Tax Investigation and Vigilance Department about the details of the illegal money held by the tax evaders (including Adiseshan) and gets them arrested on the same day. He blackmails the minister and legally reopens the foundation and soon is able to provide free, good quality education, infrastructure, services and employment to people in every district of Tamil Nadu. Led by Adiseshan, those who were blackmailed by Sivaji exploit Tamizhselvi's innocence to silence him. Fearing for Sivaji's life, she hands over Sivaji's laptop to the CBI and Income Tax officers hired by Adiseshan with all the information regarding the illegal money transactions. With presentable evidence, Sivaji is arrested. Adiseshan and the police order Sivaji to unlock his laptop through the voice-detection program, which only opens on a particular command in Sivaji's voice.
When Sivaji refuses, Adiseshan tortures him so badly that he is almost killed. To cover this up, Adiseshan and the police organise for mercenaries to shoot at the police van that will carry Sivaji's body, making it look like a murder by a third party. Sivaji, however, is faking; he was informed of the plans to kill him by a sympathetic police constable prior to the interrogation. Left alone in the room, he electrifies himself and loses consciousness. Sivaji's friend Dr Chezhian, Tamizhselvi and Arivu intercept the police van after being informed by Sivaji through a MMS and replace Sivaji's body with a dummy before the mercenaries open fire. While everyone thinks that Sivaji is dead, Chezhian revives him using a defibrillator.
Following Sivaji's ""death"", Adiseshan and the CBI still try to open Sivaji's laptop by trying to fool the voice-detection program; they fail and all the data in the laptop is erased. A few days later, while everyone wonders about the future of the Sivaji Foundation, the revived Sivaji returns to take control of the foundation in the guise of an NRI friend, M. G. Ravichandran (MGR). Though Adiseshan immediately realises that Ravichandran is actually Sivaji, he is unable to prove this to the police due to the proof of Sivaji's ""death"" and Ravichandran's identity. Later, Sivaji confronts Adiseshan and the two fight atop the terrace of Adiseshan's medical college. During the fight, Adiseshan inadvertently strikes the campus's terrace roof causing money hidden in it to fly around the campus. The students spot the money and go after it, causing a stampede in which Adiseshan is trampled to death. Sivaji Foundation soon becomes a frontier for India's economic and industrial rise."

Ibrahim wants to kill him since he, in the guise of Velayudham had thwarted every terrorist attack that he had planned in Chennai. On the day of Kaveri's marriage, a bomb planted by Ibrahim at Velu's house explodes, killing Kaveri.
A few days after Kaveri's death, a grieving Velu learns from Bharathi that Ulaganathan, the corrupt Home Minister of Tamil Nadu, is indirectly responsible for the terrorist attacks and Kaveri's death. Ulaganathan allowed Ibrahim to carry out terrorist attacks in exchange for money. He even tries to gain popularity by claiming Velayudham as his idea, planning to reveal Ibrahim as Velayudham's real identity in a function at the Nehru Stadium, Chennai.

535,Zanjeer (2013 film),"ACP Vijay Khanna is a brutally honest police officer who has been transferred yet again by the system for chasing the corrupt underworld goons. He is continuously disturbed by the killing of his parents years back. He keeps remembering a man in a black raincoat on his birthday.
Vijay is in charge of a case where the district collector has been murdered and burned to death. The key eyewitness, Mala (Priyanka Chopra), has seen the murder by Teja's (Prakash Raj) gang and refuses to cooperate. Teja is the head of an oil mafia operation and does not want Mala alive. Vijay manages to convince Mala to give a statement which makes her perpetrators come after her. He gives her shelter in his house to protect her, and she starts to like him, while Vijay does not reciprocate the same. This includes her giving him a potato and egg for lunch at his office and then annoying him by celebrating his birthday. He shouts at her, and she begins to cry. Vijay tells her that he did not want to celebrate because his parents were killed on the very day and reveal his past to her. He finally reciprocates her love as he realized that Mala is slowly becoming an important part of his life.
Vijay also encounters Sher Khan, who is into buying and selling of illegal cars. Seeing Vijay's honesty and determination, Sher Khan turns over a new leaf and mends his ways to transform into a person who now only goes by the book. He has made Vijay a friend for life and will do anything to help him out. Vijay also encounters Jaydev a.k.a. JD, a reporter who had written bad comments about Vijay in the newspaper. Seeing Vijay's honesty and integrity, Jaydev becomes an admirer of Vijay and begins to give him all the information he has regarding the oil mafia.
Meanwhile, Kataria the man who murdered the collector, has been caught by Vijay. Kataria is revealed to be Teja's man, and he reveals that they steal petrol and oil from container trucks, add kerosene in them, and smuggle them around and outside the country. Vijay uses this information and puts Kataria in custody, but the next day, he is found murdered in custody. In the middle of this, Vijay also finds about a man named Prashant Khanna, who was killed years back by Teja. Due to certain incidents that gave Vijay wrong information about the oil mafia that Teja is handling, Vijay is suspended until the investigation is done with. Now, Vijay warns Teja that there are no seniors or rules that bind him, and now, Vijay will finish Teja in his own style. Slowly, Vijay begins to destroy almost all of Teja's oil refineries, but Mala says that all these activities that Vijay is doing can have dangerous consequences.
One night, Vijay and Mala go to a restaurant for dinner, where Vijay gets attacked by two of Teja's men in the bathroom. Vijay kills both the men and calls Teja and warns him that even if he sends the rest of his 248 men (it was earlier mentioned by Teja that he has 250 workers under him), nothing will happen to Vijay. A few days later, Sher Khan invites Vijay and Mala to a party. Later on, when they are returning home, they are attacked once again by 10 of Teja's men. Vijay manages to lock Mala in a small room there and gets badly injured fighting them. He is almost killed, but just in time, Sher Khan comes there, handles the rest of the goons, and along with Mala, and takes Vijay to the hospital.
The next day, Teja comes there and criticizes Vijay, saying that he is one who can only talk and does not have the guts to face Teja. After he leaves, Mala finally tells Vijay to finish Teja once and for all. That night, Teja's men, along with Teja's trusted man Bosco, kill Jaydev, and the whole city begins to panic. Meanwhile, two sub-inspectors who work under Vijay give Sher Khan information that on the night when Kataria was murdered, Inspector Saalwe had arrested a man for a petty case, but Saalwe did not record the case, and so they suspect that Saalwe and the man he arrested had killed Kataria. So, using some of his informers, Sher Khan finds Saalwe and Bosco, who was hiding himself and Saalwe in a colony. Then, he puts them in front of the commissioner, and they agree that they had killed Kataria by breaking his neck, and they had done it on Teja's saying, as he feared that Kataria might leak all the information about his gang. The commissioner realizes Vijay's innocence and claims Teja as a wanted criminal.
Out of fear, Teja runs away into an old mine with Mona, but Vijay manages to track him down. Teja manages to get Vijay at gunpoint and pulls his coat's sleeve back.  Then, Vijay notices a tattoo on Teja's arm and realizes that he is the one who killed his parents. Then, Vijay says that Prashant, who Teja killed years back, was Vijay's father. Teja is shocked and reveals that Prashant had filed a case against him, and so, Teja had to kill Prashant. In a fit of rage, Vijay begins to beat Teja badly. Vijay then breaks Teja's arm, kicks him into a bundle of petroleum barrels, and then shoots the barrels, causing Teja to die in the blast. The government announces all the wealth to be given to Mona, who was also said to be in all of Teja's nefarious activities. The film ends with Sher Khan and Mala coming to visit Vijay at the station, Mala finally being able to cook some food for him, and Vijay smiling at Sher Khan when he sees a drug mafia case coming on TV."

As the story advances, Inder's wife Guddi comes across Akash's pen-cap inside a drawer at their home, which leads her to learn with shock and horror that Inder killed Akash. She rings up Deva, but before she utters the truth, Inder arrives with Jindaal, and Khan and detaches the telephone cord. The three men assault Guddi before Inder stabs her to death.
Eventually, Deva tracks down Khan as one of the killers of his brother and kills him by stabbing Khan to death. Later, Deva finds Akash's pen-cap among Guddi's mortal remains. So the truth revealed to Deva that Inder has joined hands with Jindal.

541,ABCD 2,"Suresh 'Suru' Mukund, a waiter in a bar, wants to be a big dancer to fulfill his late mother Durgadevi's wish, for which he is supported by his best friend Vernon Monteiro, a pizza delivery boy. Vinita ""Vinnie"" Sharma, a hairdresser, wants to be the best hip-hop dancer. Childhood friends from suburban Nalasopara, Mumbai, they form a team and participate in a national-level competition Hum Kisi Se Kum Nahin where they are disqualified from the grand finale as their moves are revealed to be copied from the performance act of the Philippine All Stars and the judges term them ""cheaters"". Everyone departs to search for jobs. Suru returns to work as a waiter, Vinnie rejoins a beauty parlor and Vernon gets back as a delivery boy where, on and off, they are insulted as cheaters. The departure of angry teammates adds injury to insult, and nothing is set to be corrected.
Suru hopes to remove the negative tag by planning to win a grander hip-hop competition in Las Vegas, the World Dance Championship, where the Philippine All Stars are highly popular. One day he watches Vishnu, a rogue visitor, prove his dance mettle to a betting visitor in the bar and convinces him repeatedly to be their choreographer. They audition for people and formulate the team. During the practices for the qualifiers, Vinod, a deaf-mute dancer, discovers Vinnie and Suru's hidden love for each other. They visit the qualifiers in Bangalore, where they are pre-insulted as cheaters, but manage to win it after Vishnu begs the audience for one last chance for the team. Although things are fine, Suru is broken when Shetty Anna, the owner of the bar where he is employed, refuses to provide him financial support extending to Rs. 25 lakhs, something he had earlier publicly promised to Suru at the time of the Hum Kisi Se Kum Nahin finale, and Suru leaves the place, angry at Anna's insulting language for Vinnie. However, Vishnu manages to get the money from Crocxz's uncle who he convinces after Suru loses hope when Vishnu gets angry at his inability to arrange team funds.

Vishnu returns while trying to save the day for Suru from the German team as they get into a fight, later admitting he had made a 'mistake' leaving without permission although he didn't want to lose a family he had yearned to create in years; he apologizes, is forgiven by Suru, and the team enters the finals. Across rehearsals, Olive gets close to Suru, and a jealous Vinnie finally confronts Suru, who initially finds it difficult to confess his love for her as they had been best friends from childhood, but eventually gets together with her. Although Olive has feelings for Suru, an in-person conversation with Vinnie assures Olive that Suru had that inherent charm with nothing to do about his sweetness, and Olive agrees to continue with the Indian Stunners after Vinnie recovers. The team enters the final, where Vinod's health worsens during an ""assemblage"" by the team, and the formation suddenly breaks down even as his friend D, who knew about his tuberculosis problem, tries to support him. Everyone has almost given up after the accident when Vinod tries to encourage Suru, who forgoes the accident and the others return to make the formation with success with Vinod at the bottom.

544,Agathiyar,"The story is about Agathiyar Muni, who is considered to be the embodiment of one of celestial intellectuals who descended on earth to enlighten human beings. During the wedding of Shiva and Goddess Parvati, the earth tilted to the northern side, as the whole world was witnessing the marriage. Shiva gave the responsibility of balancing the earth to Agathiyar by going to the southern side. Agathiyar is also given the additional responsibility of spreading goodness and equality. He has the additional task of spreading the Tamil language. Many small stories between heaven and earth are interwoven in the movie. The stories teach one to lead a simple existence without ego. It also shows how Agathiyar in this journey destroyed the ego of River Kaveri, Vindhya Mount and Ravana, thereby teaching them the greatness of humility.
Agathiyar travels southwards, while there, River Ponni talks to Agathiyar egotistically and argues with him. Finally, Agathiyar loses his temper and traps river Ponni in his Kamandalam, and sat down to meditate. Lord Vinayagar (Lord Ganesha) in the form of a crow, pushes Agathiyar Kamandalam down, thus rescuing and leading the river into its formation. Then Agathiyar named the River Ponni as River Kaveri (Crow) (In Tamil (Kakam), pushed Kamandalam and the water flows to broadly (In Tamil Virinthu Odiyathal) named as Ka + viri= Kaviri (became Kaveri in later usage).
One time Mount Vidhayan was continually growing in size due to taunting comments by Sage Narathar (Narada). So as to temper the vanity of the mountains, Sage Agathiyar travelled to the southern side via mount Vindhyan. On their way when Vindhyan saw Agathiyar, he bowed with respect and reverence, upon which sage Agathiyar jokingly asked if he would stay bowed and subdued with respect till the sage returned. Mount Vindhyan was truly benevolent and promised to not grow until the sage returns from the south. However, after passing through the mount, the sage will not require again to cross over to the northern side of Mount Vindhyan.
Narathar was speaking proudly to others. He is most reverent to Vishnu (Lord Narayana) because he always thinks and chants about only Vishnu. Agathiyar tells Narathar to watch one day for a potter. Narathar also does that and tells Agathiyar that the potter man chants about ""Narayana"" twice daily. Then, Agathiyar kept Narathar a small bowl full of oil in Narathar's hands. Agathiyar gives a rule asking Narathar to not spill one drop of oil while going around the world, and Narada does the job perfectly. Agathiyar then questions Narathar, ""how many times did you chant ""Narayana""'s name today?"" for which Narathar answered saying ""how can I even think of revering my name, when I have a burden kept in my hands?"". Agathiyar explains to Narathar, that he has one smallest burden, but even while doing that you forgot to chant your name. But that man has much troubles in his family and many burdens. But he still remembered and chanted Vishnu's name, which makes him the best devotee of Vishnu.
Ravana was in a Yazh competition with Agathiyar Muni, because of taunting comments by the Narathar Muni. But who shall be the competition's referee? Ravana called Goddess Saraswati, but Saraswati told them, we both her eyes. So, she leaves them. Then only Ravan select for ""Ponmalai"" because stones only not melting to anything. both are composing the instrument Yazh who turn composing the Yazh when the mount started to melt, they won the competition. Unfortunately, Ravana loses the competition and then Agathiyar was given new name to ""ponmalai"", it named by Pothigai Malai (meaning it was give judgement for constant (or) the judgement is impartial).
It is said that two demon brothers Ilavala and Vathapi used to kill Brahmins as a revenge in a simple manner. The two had special powers, they came up with a plan to take revenge on Brahmins. ""Vatapi"" would turn in to ripe mango. He would invite any passers-by, especially Brahmins for a grand feast at his home. After they eat the mango, Ilavala would call his brother out: ""Vathapi"" , his brother would respond from the belly of the visitor and come out alive in one piece. In the process the guest would be killed. The two demons later would enjoy a curry made of human flesh. One day, Agathiyar happened to pass by, the plan as usual, Vatapi changed into a ripe mango and the other disguised himself as brahmachari (Sage of Bachelor) who invited Agathiyar to eat at the home. Agathiyar knew about the plan due to his immense Vedic Power, he resolves to teach both a lesson. After the meal, Agathiyar simply rubbed his stomach saying ""Vathapi Jeerano bhave"" may Vathapi be digested, while other demon tries to bring his brother life, but in vain. Agathiyar plainly informed the demon that his brother has been digested and could no longer be brought back to life, bringing their treachery to an end."

He calls himself a Kuwaiti and is often derisive towards Indians.
After a night of partying, Ranjit is woken up to a phone call from his friend and receives word that negotiations between Iraq and Kuwait have collapsed, and Iraqi troops have begun their invasion of Kuwait. The next morning, Ranjit discovers that Kuwait City is now occupied by the Iraqi Army. Ranjit and Nair, his driver, go out and drive to the Indian embassy in an attempt to take their family and leave Kuwait. They are stopped by Iraqi soldiers at a checkpoint and Nair is shot dead amidst the confusion. A shocked Ranjit is then taken to the Emir's palace. There he meets Iraqi Republican Guard officer Major Khalaf bin Zayd (Inaamulhaq), who reveals that he was the one who pulled up to the checkpoint earlier and prevented Ranjit from being harmed. Major Khalaf, who knows Ranjit from Ranjit's visits to Iraq, chides him but extends his personal friendship, ensuring Ranjit and his family's safety from the soldiers.
From there, Ranjit goes to the Indian embassy where he learns that the Kuwaiti government has fled into exile. Some 170,000 Indians in Kuwait are now stranded as refugees. Iraqi forces continue to push through Kuwait and Ranjit's mansion is raided by Iraqi soldiers, but his wife and child manage to escape to his office. Ranjit convinces his friends to work together, and they set up a makeshift camp for some 500 Indians with Major Khalaf's permission. Amrita urges Ranjit to use his leverage to extricate his own family, but Ranjit, who ordinarily would have just looked out for himself, appears to have a change of heart. He decides to stay and help the other Indians leave Kuwait.
Ranjit learns that the Indian embassy in Kuwait has been evacuated and phones the Indian External Affairs Ministry in New Delhi, where he reaches the Joint Secretary, Sanjiv Kohli (Kumud Mishra), and asks for arrangements to be made for the evacuation. Later on, the camp is looted by Iraqi soldiers and harassed some of the refugees. Ranjit pays a visit to Major Khalaf and talks to him about this, to which the Major simply extends his apologies, and also reveals that President Saddam has already permitted Indians to leave Kuwait, but the problem is that they have no way to do so. Ranjit travels to Baghdad to try to negotiate safe passage out of Kuwait, but to no avail. The only remaining option, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, turns out to be helpful. He discloses that an Indian merchant ship is due to arrive in Iraq with various supplies, and permits the Indian refugees to leave on the ship. However, Ranjit later receives news of the UN embargo and that ships are barred from entering or leaving Iraq, effectively crushing their hopes of getting out.
Meanwhile, Kohli is somewhat of a sluggard, but when his father (Arun Bali) recounts their tale of woe during the partition of India, Kohli is inspired to actively help Ranjit. He approaches the national airline, Air India, to lead an evacuation of the 170,000 Indians in Kuwait and gets the Indian embassy in Amman, Jordan to issue permits. As the Indians leave Kuwait, Ranjit comes across yet another checkpoint where he encounters hostile Iraqi soldiers who, in absence of any passports or IDs, threaten to kill Amrita. A skirmish erupts between Ranjit and the soldiers, following which the people in Ranjit's convoy come forward and outnumber the Iraqi soldiers. Ranjit lets them live and the convoy passes. They arrive in Jordan where planes from Air India and Indian Airlines would fly the refugees back to India. The Indians salute Ranjit as they board the planes that will take them home. Ranjit however begins to feel guilty over his attitude towards Indians as he sees the Indian Tricolour. The film ends with Ranjit indicating that he always believed India never did anything for its citizens, but after being rescued by the country he and a lot of Indians had disowned, he may not ever say that in the future again."

The blast kills many people in the hospital including Central Minister A. Bharath Reddy. He is then arrested by NIA officer Krishnamacharya Perumal, on the charge of assassinating the minister. 
Meanwhile, Varadarajulu's goons chase down Saranya and her daughter to kill them. Saranya flees with her sick daughter into an ancient cave that houses an old temple of Lord Shiva and comes upon Akhanda, who is now an Aghora, with supernatural powers deriving from Lord Shiva. Akhanda, being a manifestation of Rudra annihilates the goons and protects Saranya and her daughter. Learning this, Gajendra and Varadarajulu get Ranjan and his men to kill Saranya and her daughter, along with the rest of the family, but Akhanda arrives and kills all of the officers except for Ranjan. Akhanda interrupts Gajendra's ritual by killing Ranjan and warns him. Gajendra then goes to Prachanda, who is a Kapalik tantrik to kill Akhanda. Meanwhile, Akhanda finds Padmavati at a river and brings her back to life, and finds out through his yogic powers that Varadarajulu and Gajendra had found out that she wanted to expose their illegal activities and Gajendra has her killed and thrown into the river. After seeing all of this through his mystic vision, Akhanda arrives at the mines and kills Varadarajulu’s men and kills Varadarajulu. 
When Krishnamacharya Perumal questions him about his misdeeds, Akhanda reveals that anyone who disturbs the very balance of nature needs to be eradicated and walks away. Krishnamacharya Perumal learns about Murali Krishna's innocence and releases him from custody. Gajendra and Prachanda devise a trap and place a cursed death spell upon Saranya's daughter knowing that Akhanda will surely go to Kasi and perform the Mrityunjay puja to free the child and bring her back to life, thereby they could kill Akhanda when he's performing the puja. Akhanda starts the ritual and Gajendra and his men interrupt by throwing weapons. Akhanda bears the pain and finishes the ritual successfully. Saranya's daughter is brought back to life. Lord Shiva enters Akhanda and manifests Akhanda with mighty powers from Shiva and wreaks havoc upon Gajendra and his men. Murali Krishna arrives and joins Akhanda in the fight. Akhanda destroys and kills Gajendra and decapitates Prachanda. Murali Krishna unites with his family and Saranya's daughter asks Akhanda to stay with their family, but Akhanda disagrees and promises the child that he will arrive whenever the child is on the verge of death and destruction."
547,Ankur (film),"Ankur is a complex film that analyzes human behaviour in general and heavily stresses characterisation (though the story is not fictional). The story revolves around two characters, Lakshmi and Surya.
Lakshmi (Shabana Azmi) lives in a village with her husband Kishtayya (Sadhu Meher), a deaf-mute alcoholic potter who communicates using gestures. The couple is poor and belongs to the lowly Dalit caste. Lakshmi attends a village festival and prays faithfully to the Goddess, stating that her only desire in life is to have a child.
Surya (Anant Nag), the son of the village landlord, had just finished his studies in the nearby city of Hyderabad and arrives back home. Surya's father (Khader Ali Beg) has a mistress named Kaushalya with whom he has an illegitimate son named Pratap. Surya's father claims to have given Kaushalya ""the best land in the village"", a gift which serves as both a token of his affection and also keeps Kaushalya quiet and satisfied. Surya is forced by his father into a child marriage with the under aged Saru (Priya Tendulkar), and begins to feel extremely sexually frustrated due to the fact that they cannot have sex until Saru reaches puberty.
Surya reluctantly takes over the administrative responsibilities of his share of land in the village. Alone, he moves into a different, older house, and Lakshmi and Kishtayya are sent as his servants. Not long after his arrival, he begins to exert his authority by introducing a number of different laws and measures, many of which are controversial among the village people. Almost immediately, Surya starts to form an attraction towards Lakshmi, and gives her the task of cooking his meals and serving him tea. This does not sit well with the village priest, a man who traditionally delivers food to the landowner, though at a higher price than Lakshmi asks.
Surya also hires Kishtayya to ride his bullock cart and run his errands. The following day, he has Kishtayya collect fertilizer from the landlord's house. Surya then uses Kishtayya's absence to flirt with Lakshmi, but she fails to reciprocate. In the meantime, the villagers have begun to gossip, and many (most notably the overseer, Police Officer Patel Sheikh Chand) believe that Surya has already slept with Lakshmi, and will act in the same way that his father did - try to conceal the scandal by giving his mistress a vast plot of land.
Kishtayya is caught stealing toddy, after which he is publicly humiliated, and he decides to leave the village due to the embarrassment. In his absence, Surya and Lakshmi sleep together. Some time later, Saru arrives at the village, in order to live with her husband. Saru does not approve of Lakshmi's presence, partly because Lakshmi is a Dalit and partly because Saru has heard the villagers' rumours. The next morning, Lakshmi has morning sickness, and Saru fires her, claiming that she is too sick to work.
Many days go by, and eventually Kishtayya returns, having cured himself of his alcoholism and made some money. Lakshmi is overwhelmed with a feeling of guilt, because she believes that she has betrayed her husband. On discovering Lakshmi's pregnancy, he salutes the village goddess at her temple, acknowledging that his wife's wish has been granted. He then decides to return to work and hopefully ride the bullock cart once again for Surya. Surya sees Kishtayya and mistakenly believes that Kishtayya is seeking revenge from him due to his infidelity with Lakshmi.
Surya orders three men to grab hold of Kishtayya and then proceeds to whip him with a rope used for lynching. The commotion attracts others, including Sheikh Chand and Pratap, to the scene, and Lakshmi rushes to defend her husband. She angrily curses Surya, then slowly returns home with Kishtayya. In the final scene, after the others have left, a young child throws a stone at Surya's glass window and runs away."
548,Annai Velankanni,"The story pivots around the centuries - an old Basilica of our lady of health at Velankanni village near Nagapattinam in Thanjavur district in Tamil Nadu.

Vijaya), a milkmaid and her son Sundaram in Velankanni village to a child patient Baby Sumathi. Mother Mary appears before Sundaram, who is on his way to the landlord's (R. Muthuraman) house at Nagapattinam to deliver milk. The landlord, a bureaucrat, is an atheist. Sundaram gives milk to mother Mary to feed the Infant Jesus.

The meet each other in the Church and eventually get married. While Mary is away from the hospital meeting Susainathan, the Kind mother attends to Mary's duties disguised as a nurse."
549,Aramm,"The story begins with District Collector Madhivadhani (Nayanthara), who is struggling with her approval to a higher official (Kitty) and telling a bone-chilling story to him.
A week ago, in Kattoor village, poor people are seen fighting with the police for clean water, sanitation, and the verdict to arrest their cruel landlord. Two boys are seen playing in a river, as their family drags them out and scolds them for going and playing there. The next day, a woman named Sumathi (Sunu Lakshmi) and her 4-year-old daughter Dhanshika (Mahalakshmi) are walking together back home. Sumathi soon learns that Dhanshika went missing and enquires the villagers, who tell her that her daughter fell into a borewell. Sumathi rushes there and faints. The villagers call the police, who in turn alerts Madhivadhani. Madhivadhani and her team rush there to assess the situation but are stopped because there is a deep ditch in the middle of the road, which delays their arrival at the site. Madhivadhani and her team finally arrive but are battered by the journalists and the news media, who criticize Madhivadhani over her late arrival and the negligence of the landlord over the open borewell.
Soon, a camp is set up. Sumathi, her husband Pulenthiran (Ramachandran Durairaj), and her son still await Dhanshika's escape. The police sends down a camera and microphone system so that Madhivadhani can talk with Dhanshika in the borewell. Madhivadhani notices that Dhanshika is not receiving enough oxygen, but the doctors ensure that Dhanshika has enough time to survive. The villagers meanwhile try to rescue Dhanshika on their own but fail every time. The police decides to carry out the ""butterfly knot"" as they demonstrate to Madhivadhani on a dummy. Madhivadhani alerts the medical team about the consequence of the process that Dhanshika's shoulder might get dislocated, but gives the approval to carry out the process. As the police reach out to Dhanshika with the knot, Dhanshika tries to hold on to the knot, but her arm hurts and she falls back into the borewell. Madhivadhani and the family are distraught over this.
The villagers, angry over the long time taken to rescue Dhanshika and the landlord's negligence, attack the police with stones. Madhivadhani then settles the doubt by telling the villagers that the landlord will get arrested and the child will be rescued. Coincidentally, the landlord gets arrested. Madhivadhani then calls for Captain Maharajan and his team from the Indian Defence Army. Maharajan has an idea: to dig out another horizontal tunnel to get Dhanshika out. Madhivadhani approves it. As Maharajan's team is digging the ground, a crack appears in the ground, which causes all the work to stop immediately. As the day darkens into night, the camera suddenly stops working. As the camera gets fixed, Dhanshika shows no response, which causes Pulenthiran to assume that she is dead. He runs off into the half-dug site as he tries to rescue Dhanshika on his own, thus causing another chaos between the villagers and the police while someone alerts the villagers that Dhanshika is still alive. The family decides to send Muthu (Ramesh Thilaganathan), Dhanshika's brother, to rescue her, which Madhivadhani reluctantly approves. Finally, Dhanshika is rescued alive. Pulenthiran, Sumathi, Muthu, and Dhanshika thank Madhivadhani. Madhivadhani sends Dhanshika to the hospital but emotionally breaks down.
Back in the present, Madhivadhani competes with the higher official and resigns from her post as a district collector. She then decides that she will do something for her people as an ordinary person. The film then ends with a timeline slideshow of incidents of children falling in neglected borewells."
550,Aravindhan,"Aravindhan is preparing to clear IPS to become a police officer. But after he sees Thamizhvannan, shown as a Naxalite, shot dead by police, Aravindhan starts a fight against police and corrupt politicians.
Aravindhan gets supported by the people for his strict fight against corruption. Anu loves Aravindhan, but her father does not accept the relation. The police wants to put Aravindhan in jail for the politicians, so Aravindhan goes into hiding. On the way, he hides in Gayathri's home. The police tries to catch Aravindhan but at the same time, thinks Gayathri tried to give shelter to Aravindhan, so Gayathri's father dies. Now Aravindhan understands that he has to save Gayathri, so he takes her with him to a factory area to stay.
Aravindhan works in the factory and life goes along smooth for him as he marries Gayathri and has a child. Once in factory, the manager does not give fair price to the workers, which Aravindhan protests, so he beats the manager very poorly. The factory people now identifies Aravindhan's true identity as a Naxalite. The police comes in search of Aravindhan, who finally surrenders in court. In jail, Aravindhan writes lot of anti-corruption articles. This gives Aravindhan wide public support to get elected as a minister. The corrupt politicians want to avoid this uprising and hire a gunman to shoot Aravindhan. During a stage speaking with many people around, the gunman shoots and kills Aravindhan, thus precluding him from becoming minister."
551,Article 15 (film),"In the village of Laalgaon, two Dalit girls are seen trapped in a school bus by some men. Ayan Ranjan, a St. Stephen's College, Delhi graduate and an Indian Police Service officer, is assigned to Laalgaon as the Additional Superintendent of Police and is warmly welcomed by officers Brahmadatt Singh and Kisan Jatav. Ayan encounters various forms of caste discrimination as soon as he arrives in the village, and periodically shares what he observes to his wife, Aditi, over the phone. Local villagers come to Ayan's reception asking the officers to find the missing girls but are turned down. Ayan reunites with his college friend Satyendra Rai, who is also a state government employee, who behaves suspiciously throughout the night.
The next morning, the girls are found hanging from a tree, while a third girl, Pooja, is reported missing. Ayan orders Brahmadatt to file an FIR and to obtain the postmortem report for the deceased girls. The girls' autopsy yields evidence that they were gang raped, but Brahmadatt prevents the release of this information and instead pushes a narrative suggesting that the girls, who were cousins, were lesbians and thus hanged by their fathers in an honor killing. Meanwhile, Jatav and a junior officer are threatened and their vehicle set on fire by followers of Nishad, the leader of a group of activists within the village who seek speedy justice for the crime. Ayan questions Jatav about this the next day and becomes determined to solve the case.
Gaura, Pooja's sister, informs Ayan that the girls used to work for a local builder named Anshu Naharia, who slapped Pooja after the girls asked for a raise in their salary of 3 rupees. Ayan decides to call Anshu for inquiry, even though Brahmadatt tries to persuade him not to do so, as Anshu is the son of local Minister Ramlal Naharia. During his interrogation, Anshu says that he slapped the girls to remind their entire caste of their place in society. Ayan, disgusted by the moral corruption of the village and its police force, posts on the police bulletin board a copy of Article 15 of the Constitution of India, which prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, caste, or birthplace.
Ayan meets with Dr. Malti Ram, the assistant coroner who performed the autopsy, and finds out that contrary to her official report, the girls were raped and then murdered. He asks her to go to Lucknow to examine the DNA samples and to contact only him, realizing that local law enforcement is conspiring with Ramlal Naharia to cover up the case. Meanwhile, Mahantji, a Brahmin politician vying for a local election, has formed an alliance with the head of the Laalgaon Dalit community in a show of inter-caste unity, but Nishad sees the display as a disingenuous political ploy and plans to protest it. Ayan tries to persuade Nishad to call off the protest, so he has men to help search for Pooja; Nishad refuses, but allows some of his men to aid Ayan's search.
Ayan soon gets a call from Malti, who confirms that Anshu was the one who gang-raped and murdered the two girls. Ayan gets an arrest warrant for Anshu and raids his house, but Anshu is not present. However, Ayan spots a school bus that was seen by local villagers around the time of the girls' disappearance, and investigates the nearby school (which is owned by Anshu), where he finds evidence from the scene of girls' torture and rape. Elsewhere, Anshu is staying under protection from Brahmadatt, who is revealed to be one of the rapists. Brahmadatt kills Anshu to save himself.
Panikar, a high-ranking CBI officer, arrives in Laalgaon and suspends Ayan from the case. Ayan refuses to give up his efforts and tracks down Satyendra, who admits that he was at a party hosted by Anshu the night of the crime, and that he witnessed Anshu, Brahmadatt, and police officer Nihal Singh (who works closely with Ayan) rape the girls while severely drunk and later hang their dead bodies. Ayan confronts Nihal, who commits suicide out of remorse.
Jatav arrests Brahmadatt on Ayan's command. Panikar attempts to threaten Ayan into dropping the case, but Ayan reveals he has already submitted all his evidence to the Home Minister, and sharply criticizes the bigotry and injustice against people of lower castes among Indian law enforcement. Ayan then leads other officers through a large swamp in search of Pooja. They emerge on the other side in a jungle where they find a severely dehydrated Pooja hiding inside a pipe. They rescue her, and with her statement, Brahmadutt gets eleven years of imprisonment as punishment. Mahantji wins the election, hands down."
552,Arunagirinathar (film),"Arunagirinathar was born in the town of Tiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu.

Murugan cures his leprosy, shows him a path of religious devotion, and initiates his composition of the Thiruppugal, an anthology of songs dedicated to Murugan."
553,Azhar (film),"The film begins with Indian cricketer Azhar scoring a century in his 99th test match, but he soon faces allegations of match-fixing as his name has been linked with a London based bookie M.K. Sharma aka Shaun. The Indian cricket board slaps a life-ban on him. Azhar decides to challenge the ban in court with the help of his lawyer friend Reddy.
The story shifts back to 1963, when Azhar was born to a comfortable middle-class family in Hyderabad. His grandfather dreamt of Azhar playing 100 tests for Team India and motivates a soft-spoken young Azhar to answer his rivals with his batting skills. Young Azhar goes for an Indian team selection match to Mumbai, where on the match day he receives the bad news of his grandfather's death. Nonetheless, he participates in the match, in accordance with his grandfather's last wish.
Azhar impresses the selectors, sealing his place in Team India and he soon becomes a national hero by scoring 3 consecutive centuries in his first 3 Test innings. Azhar soon marries Naureen and they both begin a happy married life. After a loss against Pakistan in 1991, the President of Cricket Board calls Azhar for a one-to-one meeting. Azhar initially fears getting dropped from the team, but is surprised when he is offered the position of team Captain. Some senior players like Manoj, Ravi and Navjot, resent Azhar's appointment as Captain, not wishing to take orders from a younger and less experienced player. But Kapil supports and encourages him to focus on his duty.
While playing in an India–Pakistan match, Javed taunts Azhar, telling Azhar his Muslim heritage would be a better fit for the Pakistan team. Azhar leads his team to victory and soon becomes a successful Captain. At the peak of his career, Azhar's personal life takes a twist when he meets a former Miss India and famous Bollywood actress Sangeeta during an advertising film shoot and instantaneously falls in love with her. Sangeeta likes him too but, aware that he is already married, she warns him to stay away from her. Nevertheless, Azhar is infatuated by her beauty and does not listen to her advice. They begin dating but keep their relationship hidden, until it is suddenly exposed by a gossip magazine.
Azhar has no alternative but to publicly announce his affair with Sangeeta. Heartbroken, Naureen asks him for a divorce and soon Azhar leaves her to marry Sangeeta. During a cricket match against the West Indies, Azhar gets in a spat with team-mate Manoj for a slow run rate in order to complete his century, letting the team lose. Manoj is dropped from the next match and Azhar leads the team to victory. Manoj is humiliated and vows to take revenge. In later years of his career, Azhar, famous for his expensive lifestyle, comes into the eyes of match-fixers. He is soon approached by a London-based bookie M.K Sharma, disguised as a diamond merchant, who later offers him 10 million rupees to under play in a match against Sri Lanka, which Azhar hesitantly accepts.
In a parallel story, after the match-fixing scandal, Azhar is now facing nationwide criticism and a prosecutor, Meera, is building up a strong case against him on the basis of sting operations done by Manoj on Ravi, Navjot and several other cricketers. She also uses the report of the inquiry commission set up by the Cricket Board and secretly meets the bookie M. K. Sharma to gather more evidence. Meera also approaches Naureen, asking her to serve as a witness, but she refuses. Meanwhile, Azhar and his lawyer Reddy are struggling to find any proof of innocence as none of his fellow cricketers are ready to help him out.
Azhar attends a gym-opening ceremony to gain back his old fame in public, but is left insulted by the owner himself. After a long, eight-year legal fight, Reddy finally makes a breakthrough by proving in court that the inquiry commission report is biased, as they were paid by the Cricket Board itself. Reddy even challenges the authenticity of sting operation tapes as none of the witnesses were under oath and hence can not be treated as truth. Later, Azhar also reveals that he took 10 million rupees from the bookie to keep him away from other team members but later scored a match winning innings and returned all the money to the bookie.
On the final day of judgement, both Naureen and Sangeeta attend the court hearing, showing their support for Azhar. Kapil also states in a television interview that he believes Azhar is innocent. In its final verdict, the court lifts the India cricket board ban imposed on Azhar."
554,Baadshaho,"In 1973, Maharani Gitanjali is a princess to a royal family in Rajasthan. Although every royal family was required to turn over their wealth at the end of the ancestral reign, her ancestors did not hand it over to the government. Two years later, in 1975, the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, declares a state of emergency in the country. Sanjeev, an influential person in the Congress government, plots revenge against Gitanjali after he was snubbed badly by her in 1973. Sanjeev asks army officer Colonel Rudra Pratap Singh to confiscate all the gold in Gitanjali's possession and to put her behind bars. Rudra follows Sanjeev's instructions and imprisons Gitanjali after forcibly taking possession of her gold.
Rudra asks his trusted lieutenants, Major Seher Singh and Captain Somesh, to transfer all the gold to Delhi into the government's safekeeping. For this purpose, he gives Seher Singh a custom-made truck with a powerful safe to transport the confiscated gold. As Rudra and Seher Singh are discussing, Sanjana, Gitanjali's trusted aide, is sent by her to eavesdrop on their conversation and get a whiff of their plan. Gitanjali then plans an entire scheme; she wants Sanjana to accompany Bhawani Singh in getting all the gold back and eventually release her from jail.
Gitanjali briefs Bhawani Singh, her trusted lieutenant, about the gold and her reasons for keeping it - she needs the money to look after the people in her village. The loyal Bhawani Singh promises to retrieve the gold and return it to Gitanjali, with whom he shares a romantic relationship.
Bhawani Singh, along with Daliya, Guruji, and Sanjana, chalk out their plan and set out on the mission. The four follow the truck in which Seher Singh and his deputy, Somesh, are carrying the gold to Delhi. The group takes control of the truck after throwing out Seher Singh and Somesh. The job now is to open the strong safe, something at which Guruji is adept. Meanwhile, Seher Singh, boss Rudra Pratap Singh, and other army and police officers are hot on the trail of Bhawani Singh and the truck. At one point, the army officers seek the help of police officer Durjan, but Bhawani Singh and his team members outwit him.
Before Bhawani Singh can return the gold to Gitanjali Devi, he learns that Gitanjali used him for her personal happiness and motives, and that Seher was her aide. Bhawani reveals that he already knew the dark truth about Gitanjali, and his team decided to distribute gold among poor people who suffered from Gitanjali's wrath. After the war between Seher and Bhawani's team ends, Gitanjali realizes that she is alone in the desert with a low chance of survival, while Bhawani and his team escape."
555,Bandishala,"The film opens with a riot happening at the Satara Prison among the inmates. A few inmates end up severely injuring their fellow inmates. Senior Inspector Madhavi Sawant(Mukta Barve), the jailor arrives in the nick of time and prevents any major casualty from happening. Raghu Farakate(Umesh Jagtap) a hardened politically connected criminal with a track record of constantly escaping from the prison, highly detests Madhavi. Madhavi stays with her husband Shekhar (Vikram Gaikwad) and adopted daughter Shabana. Her close friend Rukhsana (Hemangi Kavi) often faces domestic abuse at the hands of her drunkard husband, which is known to Madhavi. To teach Raghu a lesson, Madhavi has him tonsured in front of all inmates. Two henchmen of Raghu in the prison, who try to rape an under trail prisoner, are brutally beaten by Madhavi. Dr. Salunkhe, a medical officer in charge of the Satara prison, is bribed by Raghu to prepare a false certificate to shift him and his gang to Atpadi. Bhagwantrao Gaikwad (Pravin Tarde) a contractor working under Minister Sapanrao, offers Madhavi a large sum of money as bribe to release Raghu and his gang for his own benefits. Raghu's lawyer requests Madhavi to send him to Atpadi. Madhavi, who is well aware of Raghu's corrupt track record, tears the notice to pieces. Raghu insults Madhavi by calling her an infertile whore. Angered, Madhavi beats up Raghu so brutally, that he is contracts paraplegia. DIG Sudamrao, who is directly connected with Minister Sapanrao, reprimands Madhavi for her acts and sets up a departmental enquiry against her. She blackmails him by showing him proofs of his illegal contracts and connections with politicians.
One night, while returning home from a wedding, Madhavi and her family are ambushed by a gang of thugs who kidnap Madhavi. Madhavi ends up getting severally raped and tortured by the goons, who throw her naked in the forest. An elderly couple rescue her and informs her family, who are shattered after hearing this. Madhavi is hospitalized and recovers soon. But the public start looking at her as a disgrace to the family. After a month of rehabilitation, Madhavi is restored on the position of the jailor, but constantly remains traumatized due to this incident. Subsequently, the police team led by Inspector Ramesh Nimbalkar, succeed in tracking down the rapists and arrest them. The trial begins with Advocate Raorane, an extremely high-profile lawyer, defending the culprits. Madhavi, in a bid to present a solid proof against Raghu Farakate in the court, tracks down a bar dancer who happens to be Bhagwantrao's mistress. Madhavi insists her to secretly record the meeting between Bhagwantrao, Sudamrao and Sapanrao. This clip proves the gang of rapists led by Dilip Javalikar guilty and exposes the nexus of Madhavi's seniors. Raorane attempts to defame Madhavi in the court by shamelessly mentioning her infertility and her violent nature as a reason for her false appeal. Madhavi, in her defence, says that she has already lost her respect. But if the gang is acquitted, they will surely attempt to rape another woman. She also exposes the 2 failed marriages of Raorane and the accusation of sexual assault he is facing from his 3rd wife. The court finally sentences the gang to life imprisonment and has DIG Sudamrao suspended. Bhagwantrao and Sapanrao are also charged with molestation and contract killing. Madhavi gets Rukhsana to kill Raghu Farakate in the hospital. Dilip while trying to escape from police gets severely beaten by Madhavi and the protesting women. Subsequently, he succumbs to his injuries. Finally Madhavi has the entire nexus of her superiors killed in a road accident."
556,Batla House,"Deputy Commissioner of Police Sanjeev Kumar Yadav is informed that his team has cornered 5 university students in L-18, Batla House, who might have been involved in the 13 September 2008 Delhi bombings, the responsibility for which was claimed by the terrorist organization ""Indian Mujahideen"" (IM). Sanjeev orders not to engage until he arrives, but a relentless inspector, Mohan Chand Sharma alias M. C., proceeds with some officers. Sanjeev arrives and, upon hearing the gunshots, decides to engage. The building is cleared, and M. C. is found shot down. Sanjeev enters the room, and there's more shooting, as a result of which two students, Adil Ameen & Sadiq Khan, end up dead, and Tufail Khan is arrested alive. Dilshad Ahmed and Jawed Ali escape and Sanjay now starts facing the heat from media and politicians, who start billing the encounter as a fake one. They're joined by the whole nation in condemning the Delhi Police, and everyone starts demanding justice for the students who were supposedly killed to account for the bombings. Sanjeev's wife, Shobhna Yadav, a news anchor, is however unwilling to accept this and decides to stay with Sanjeev, who soon becomes diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, frequently hallucinating about getting shot by the terrorists. Shobhna somehow stops him whenever he becomes suicidal.
Sanjay now starts looking for the missing Dilshad and Jawed and finds one of them to be hiding in Nizampur, Uttar Pradesh. He is informed by the police commissioner that he would be awarded for the encounter and that he must celebrate. Realizing he's not been told where to celebrate, he heads to Nizampur, where he manages to find Dilshad, one of the fugitives. Everyone tries to stop Sanjay, who chases, beats up, and almost arrests Dilshad, only for him to be cornered by the politicians and the public who let him escape but without Dilshad.
After being awarded the President Medal, Sanjeev begins his hunt again and this time, through Dilshad's girlfriend Victoria alias ""Huma"", tricks him into coming to Nepal. He teams up with his officers once again and sends a van to pick up Dilshad, as a part of his plan. The latter, however, sends someone else to check for anything suspicious. Sanjeev runs to stop his officers from engaging upon realizing Dilshad's not in the van and lets it flee. Learning of nothing suspicious, Dilshad informs the van driver he'd depart the next day, and upon landing in Nepal, is stopped, thrashed, and arrested by Sanjeev and his team.
The court proceedings begin, where the opposing lawyer, Shailesh Arya, brings up arguments to counter Sanjay's truth and a parallel story of fake encounters, as per which K. K. and his men brought the students in L-18 tortured, and decided to kill them when they were ordered not to do so, following which K. K. was shot by one of his officers. Sanjay, however, brings out the truth that actually, his officers had been closely watching the students and realized they belonged to the IM. The real shootout then plays out, showcasing K. K. and his team engaging during the students' fire, and the very fact that K. K. died while giving Sanjay's argument strong support when he tells everyone that no officer has ever died in a fake encounter. His arguments convince the court to sentence the 2 terrorists to life imprisonment, while the last one somehow escapes the country.
While sections of the media still oppose the ruling and believe the police to be culprits, a video clip that surfaced in 2016 featured a confession from the terrorist Jawed who had escaped the encounter, about how he managed to do so and later join the ISIS, further confirming the credibility of the encounter."
557,Bawandar,"Bawandar is based on the true story of Bhanwari Devi's gang-rape case. The names of characters and places have been changed for legal reasons. For example, Bhanwari's character is called Sanwari, her husband Mohan's character is called Sohan, and their village is called Dhabri (Bhateri in real life).
The story is introduced through first-person narration by a foreign reporter called Amy (Laila Rouass), who has read about Sanwari's case in a newspaper. Amy and her friend-cum-interpreter Ravi (Rahul Khanna) visit Sanwari's village to investigate the matter, five years after the gang-rape incident. Upon their arrival in Rajasthan, Amy and Ravi meet a rickshaw-puller named Sohan (Raghuvir Yadav) by happenstance, who helps them on their way to a village where they encounter Sanwari's rapists. Sohan turns out to be Sanwari's husband, and tells the tale of Sanwari's rape case.
Sohan and Sanwari are a married couple belonging to a low-caste Kumhar (potter) community. The couple live with Sohan's parents and have a two children, a young girl and a boy. Sanwari makes pots whilst Sohan plies the rickshaw for their subsistence. While working at a local quarry, Sanwari stands up for her rights to the corrupt supervisor. The news of her bravery reaches Shobha Devi (Deepti Naval), a social worker who works for the Government of India. Her job involves creating awareness amongst the illiterate villagers against social evils like child marriage, oppression of women etc. In Dhabri, she recruits Sanwari (Nandita Das) as a Saathin, a grassroots worker employed as part of the Women's Development Project run by the Government of Rajasthan.
As part of her job, Sanwari educates the womenfolk in the village against child marriages and oppression against women, and invites ire of the conservative village elders. Most of these villagers belong to the Gurjar community, a higher caste. To subjugate Sanwari, five members of the Gurjar community order a social and economic boycott of Sanwari and her family. The villagers stop selling milk to her family or buying the earthen pots they make. When Sanwari informs the police about a child marriage happening in the Gurjar community, five men from the Gurjar household where the marriage was supposed to happen decide to teach Sanwari a lesson. Having had enough of her shenanigans and what they perceive as her affront to their male ego, they collectively beat up her husband and two of them take turns in gang-raping her.
Despite the horrific nature of the incident and the stigma attached to it, Sanwari and Sohan muster up courage and go to the police station to lodged a First Information Report, but the corrupt inspector (Ravi Jhankal) refuses to lodge the FIR in absence of a medical report. The doctor refuses to issue a medical report in the absence of a court order, explaining that he cannot do so because it's a rape case. With Shobha's help, the couple finally manages to get a court order. With the court order, they get a medical test done in Jaipur, and a complaint is lodged two days after the incident.
However, the rapists are not arrested and roam around freely, boasting about their lustful experience with Sanwari. Sanwari's case gets nationwide attention after the head of a women's NGO in Delhi gets involved and tries to help Sanwari. The Prime Minister of India himself entrusts the investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation and offers Rs. 1 lakh as support to Sanwari from the Prime Minister's Relief Fund.
The accused are arrested and tried in the court, but they are backed by the local MLA Dhanraj Meena (Govind Namdeo). Meena hires a lawyer called Purohit to defend the accused. A Gurjar lawyer (Gulshan Grover) defends Saanwari, but faces pressure from his community to favor the accuse. The judges handling the case are transferred multiple times, and the final judgement goes against her, with all 5 of the accused walking away scot free.
The movie ends with actress Deepti Naval talking about how Bhanwari Devi has refuses to give up her fight for justice, in spite of unhelpful villagers and relatives, an incompetent police force, and a corrupt judicial system, and is today active as a rape activist who helps provide help, counseling and inspiration to women who have suffered such injustices as well."
558,Bell Bottom (2021 film),"In 1984, Indian Airlines Flight 691 (resembling Indian Airlines Flight 421) is hijacked, the seventh such hijacking in India in five years, with all the previous ones ending in acquiescence to the hijackers' demands that other terrorists be freed and money be delivered. During her briefing, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, frustrated at the lack of action taken on the matter, decides to allow a RAW agent code-named ""Bell Bottom"" to handle the case. As a ""mere"" clerk, he is already viewed with consternation by the other officials, and his deduction that the alleged masterminds, a Khalistan separatist group named ""Azaadi Dal"" (lit. 'Liberation Organisation'), are merely a front for Pakistan's ISI are rebuffed by them due to improving Indo-Pakistani relations. After the plane lands in Amritsar when he predicted it would land in Lahore, he is dismissed. However, his supervisor points out that he is an expert on hijackings and is motivated by personal experience.
In 1979, polymath Anshul Malhotra lives with his mother Raavi, an asthmatic who constantly visits his brother in London, and his wife Radhika. Her flight is hijacked by terrorists, but then-PM Morarji Desai and Pakistani President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq negotiate and fulfill the hijackers demands in exchange for the hostages' release. However, Raavi dies, reportedly due to natural causes. Soon after, though, Anshul is abducted by RAW, who reveal that one of the hijackers, Daljeet ""Doddy"" Singh, had purposely withheld her inhaler, pusher her into the galley and thrown heavy blankets on her, increasing her suffering as she died. Anshul is given the offer to join RAW; he accepts and takes on the code-name Bell Bottom, with his cover to his wife being that he is an embassy officer. After his training, which showcases his extraordinary memory and improves his previously subpar physical skills, he is assigned to the hijacking desk. In 1983, he finds one of the hijackers while visiting his brother in London and tracks them; he raids their house with other RAW agents and captures three of them but the fourth, Doddy Singh, escapes.
Back in the present, the plane takes off from Amritsar and lands in Lahore, prompting Gandhi to order Anshul back in. He convinces her to ""break script"" and disallow the Pakistani side to send their negotiating team, and orders them not to refuel the plane. In response, Zia sends his minister to keep track of the situation. In Lahore, the minister replaces the hijacker with Doddy and supplies weapons and explosives. Correctly figuring that they will go to the Middle East to take advantage of their naivety in aerial terrorism, Anshul prepares for a covert operation in Dubai against the Indian ministers' wishes. Meanwhile, the Pakistani minister goes to Dubai to observe what is going on and guide Doddy.
Upon arrival, Anshul and his team, disguised as diplomatic aides, meet up with a contact in the Dubai airport, where they see Dubai's emphasis on humanitarianism and avoidance of bloodshed. Their first plan, covertly entering the aircraft and disarming the hijackers, is foiled when the Pakistani minister notices and closes the luggage door. Anshul's ""plan B"", sending in the Indian army, is also curtailed when the Dubai officials are notified and the ship they are on is denied entry. With all avenues cut off, the ministers go to negiotate; although they agree to the terrorists' demands of money, more terrorist releases, and a charter flight to London for freedom, they are surprised at the terrorists extreme inhumanity and one of them is taken hostage as a ""VIP"" target to be held until they get to London. Seemingly out of options, Anshul asks their airport contact to take them to an under-construction terminal so they can view the proceedings; however this is a ruse as Anshul reveals his knowledge of the contact's betrayal and ties her up. Disguising themselves as airport workers, they take advantage of a sandstorm to get on the field, free the VIPs, and capture the terrorists, redirecting the charter flight to India. The leader of Dubai denies them take off clearance at first, but after Anshul explains how their methods fit in with Dubai's humanism, he grants it. In India, the terrorists are booked, with Zia and the ISI leaders huffing in disgrace, and the flight is returned, with all on board safe and sound and reunited with their families. In the end, it is revealed that Radhika was actually working for RAW and had informed them of her husband's abilities and background in the first place."
559,Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,"The film starts in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, in which Milkha Singh is competing in the 400-metre. His coach yells ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag!"" (""Run, Milkha, run!""), and Singh is suddenly taken back to the memories of his childhood which haunt him, resulting in him dropping to fourth place. His memories are of the chaos surrounding the 1947 Partition of India, which resulted in mass religious violence in Punjab and the killing of Singh's parents. The flashback shows Singh reaching Delhi alone, where he later meets his sister. Living in impoverished refugee camps, Milkha makes friends and survives by stealing with them. Now grown up, he falls in love with Biro, who asks him to live a life of honesty.
Milkha soon finds himself in the army. There, he wins a race in which the top 10 runners are rewarded milk, two eggs, and are excused from fatigue duty; his running skills are noticed by a havaldar (sergeant). He gets selected for service commission, where he is miffed. On the day before selection of the Indian team for the Olympics, Singh is beaten up by senior players whom he had defeated earlier. Despite being injured, he participates in the race and overcomes his pain; he wins the race and breaks the national record. Proud of his achievement, Milkha goes back to Delhi to ask Biro's hand in marriage. However, his friend informs him that Biro was married and left Delhi.
During the Melbourne 1956 Olympics, Singh is attracted to Stella, the granddaughter of his Australian technical coach. After a frolicking night in a bar, they have a one-night stand. The following day, he feels exhausted from the night's activities and loses the final race. He realises his mistake and, suffering from guilt, he even slaps himself in front of a mirror. On the flight back to India, he asks his coach what the world record is for the 400m race and learns that it is 45.9 seconds. A montage of tyre training in the cold desert of the Himalayas is depicted, wherein Milkha Singh pushes himself to the brink of absolute exhaustion. He subsequently enters the 1958 Asian Games with the hope of winning Gold for India. He then sees Abdul Khaliq, dubbed the ""Fastest Man of Asia"". After Abdul wins his race, Milkha Singh approaches him to congratulate the victor. However, the Pakistani coach and his athlete shun and disrespect him. But in the 200m, he defeats Khaliq by a considerable margin. Moving to the Commonwealth Games, he wins another Gold in the 400m and is named ""The King of England"" by various newspapers. After celebrating his victory along with his teammates in the army, he burns the paper on which the time of 45.9 seconds was written, indicating that he was ready to break the world record of 400m. He finally achieves his life-long dream by breaking the 400m world record.
Invited by the prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, to lead the Indian team in Pakistan for a friendly race with Abdul Khaliq, Singh adamantly refuses to go due to the trauma of having to flee his home in the newly formed Pakistan as a child. The prime minister learns of Singh's opposition but ultimately convinces him to go. Arriving in Pakistan, Singh misses the press conference and goes to his village where, in a flashback, it is shown how his parents were murdered and the last words of his father were ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag!"". He starts crying and is comforted by a boy who turns out to be the son of his childhood friend, Sampreet. He then meets Sampreet, who evidently survived the chaos of partition.
In the games, initially, Khaliq is winning, but Singh takes the lead after overtaking opponents one by one. Impressed how easily Singh passed the Pakistani athlete and won by a humongous margin, the president of Pakistan, General Ayub Khan, gives him the title of ""The Flying Sikh"". Jawaharlal Nehru declares a day in the name of Milkha as a national holiday as requested by Singh himself. A final sequence of Milkha Singh is depicted where he is enjoying his victory lap and everybody in the stadium is in awe of what he has achieved. He sees his younger self running beside him, as the film ends."

568,Chittagong (film),"The story is set against the backdrop of a little-known saga in 1930s British colonial India's East Bengal (now Bangladesh) where a group of schoolboys and young women, led by a schoolteacher Masterda Surya Sen (Manoj Bajpayee), dared to take on the Empire. Chittagong is the story of a diffident 14-year-old boy, Jhunku (Delzad Hiwale). Swept up into this seemingly impossible mission, the reluctant teenager battles with self-doubts to achieve an improbable triumph.
Jhunku, now a 23-year-old youth, is being chased by the Bengal police. He hides himself in a bunker with his childhood friend Aparna (Apu/Opu). While hiding, he begins to reflect on his past hopes and dreams. The story goes to a flashback to narrate the events that happened 10 years ago.
In 1930, Surya Sen and his followers are protesting the death of the revolutionary Jatin Das. Jhunku is not allowed to join them by his lawyer father who wants him to study in England. Apart from fearing his father, Jhunku is also torn between his admiration and respect for the magistrate, Wilkinson (Barry John) and his wife, who show great likings for him and his fascination for the charismatic figure of Masterda, who is followed and revered by most of his friends. Jhunku, due to his faith in Wilkinson who is personally against torturing revolutionaries, has great belief in British justice and believes that by getting an English education he might better equip himself to free his country. This causes arguments between him and his friends, especially Aparna. Wilkinson is opposed by the police inspector Major Johnson who defies his orders and arrests the protesters, and badly tortures Masterda.
In protest, some students hit the strict police officer Maj. Johnson (Alexx O'Nell) by spilling oil under his motorbike, making him fall. Enraged, Johnson makes random enquiries about the culprits but is unsuccessful. However, Wilkinson manages to confirm the truth out of Jhunku, and an enraged Johnson then shoots Sukhen (Shaheb Bhattacharya), one of the boys involved. This incident makes Jhunku an outcast amongst his friends, and he becomes determined to avenge the death of Sukhen. Soon afterwards, Johnson is made the DIG of police although Wilkinson had requested his transfer. This incident further shocks Jhunku. All his faith on his tutor Sir Wilkinson is lost, and he joins Masterda's army. Meanwhile, Pritilata Waddedar (Vega Tamotia) a school teacher by profession, is fascinated by the ideologies of Masterda and has great admiration for him. She wishes to join him in his future plans against the British Rule. She also appears to be in love with Nirmal sen (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) but he is reluctant to express his feelings.
Masterda and his comrades Nirmal Sen, Loknath Bal (Rajkummar Rao), Ambika Chakraborthy (Dibyendu Bhattacharya) and Ananta Singh (Jaideep Ahlawat) train the 50-odd students and plan to capture the city of Chittagong on 18 April 1930 by disconnecting all modes of communication. As per plan, the armoury of the police is captured by a group of revolutionaries led by Ganesh Ghosh and revolutionaries, led by Lokenath Baul takes over the Auxiliary Force armoury. Unfortunately the machine guns are not located. The revolutionaries also dislocate telephone and telegraph communications and disrupt the movement of the trains. After the successful raids, all the revolutionary groups gathered outside the police armoury where Surya Sen takes a military salute, hoisting the national flag and proclaims a provisional revolutionary government. The whole town is overjoyed at the success of Indian Republican Army and Chittagong is officially conquered by Surya Sen and his boys for one day. However, reinforcements from Calcutta soon set out to capture the rebels. Knowing of the army attack, the revolutionaries leave town before dawn and march towards the Jalalabad hill ranges, looking for a safe place. But the British Army's first wave is demolished by Masterda's teenagers. This enrages the British and they bring in machine guns. Harish also known as Tegra, the younger brother of Lokenath and a friend of Jhunku, dies.
Soon after revolutionaries disperse in smaller groups, to nearby villages. Ahsanullah Khan (Anurag Arora) from CID comes to Chittagong and cracks down on the revolutionaries. Jhunku is arrested and is severely beaten by Johnson and Ahsanullah during interrogation; he refuses to betray his leaders and comrades. He is sentenced to Kaala-Paani for life imprisonment. In due course, many revolutionaries and police officials are killed in the gun fights including noted revolutionary Nirmal Sen and police CID chief Ahsanullah. However, Pritilata Waddedar successfully attacks the Pahartali European Club and assassinates DIG Johnson; being gravely wounded she commits suicide by swallowing cyanide.
After a prolonged search, police search and arrests Master Da Surya Sen and sentences him to death by hanging. Thus Jhunku ends narrating the part and says that he was released in 1939 and again participated in the uprisings with Aparna. In one such incident there is a plan to attack the government godowns where the Britishers and feudal landlords have kept common peasant's grain. The British block all the roads to godowns leading Jhunku to an idea to create underground dungeons till the granaries. Twenty villages join hands and operate. The last scene shows Jhunku being stopped by Maj. Wilkinson who says he is still sympathetic to Jhunku and wants him to go away else he will be bound to arrest him once again. Jhunku signals to Wilkinson that everyone is awake and shows him the mass crowd arising from the dungeons and heading towards the government granaries that forces Wilkinson to retreat. This is named the Tebagha Uprising of 1945, which marked the end of British Raj in India. The film ends with the memorable song ""Ishaan."""

Unable to afford wrestling mats, Mahavir uses mattresses and trains them in freestyle wrestling to prepare them for competitive events. Geeta goes on to win the junior and senior championships at the state and national levels before heading to the National Sports Academy in Patiala to train for the forthcoming Commonwealth Games.
Once there, Geeta makes friends and begins to disregard the discipline taught by Mahavir under duress from her coach Pramod Kadam, whose training methods and wrestling techniques completely differ from her father's. Therefore, she loses every match at the international level. During a visit home, she defeats a visibly exhausted Mahavir in a ferocious bout after egotistically mocking him. Babita reminds Geeta of her mistake and that she should respect Mahavir. Soon after, Babita wins the national championship and follows Geeta to the academy. After the two sisters have an emotional conversation in which Babita provides her encouragement, Geeta tearfully makes peace with Mahavir.
Before the Commonwealth Games, Pramod forces Geeta to compete in the 51 kg weight class rather than in her usual 55 kg. Irritated upon learning this, Mahavir goes to Patiala with his nephew Omkar and begins coaching the girls secretly. Learning about this, and furious with Mahavir's interference, Pramod wants the girls expelled; the sports authority issues a warning but allows them to continue. Mahavir is barred from entering the academy, and the girls are forbidden to go out. Determined to continue assisting his daughters, Mahavir obtains tapes of Geeta's previous unsuccessful bouts and coaches her by pointing out her errors over the phone.
At the games, competing in the 55 kg class, Geeta eases her way into the final. Mahavir constantly contradicts Pramod's instructions while sitting in the audience, and she follows her father's instructions instead. Just before the gold medal bout, jealous Pramod conspires to lock Mahavir in a room.
In the bout, Geeta manages to win the first session but loses the second. Trailing 1–5 in the final session and with nine seconds left, she recalls the tactics taught by her father and a 5-pointer, and executes it on her opponent in the final three seconds, taking the score to 6–5 in her favor, thus winning the session and the bout 2–1. In the process, she becomes the first Indian female wrestler to win gold at the Commonwealth Games. Mahavir returns just in time to embrace his daughters, dashing Pramod's hopes of obtaining credit before the news media."

Guna finds an online photo of Sashi, who attended school with Butta. Guna believes that Sashi may be a good romantic match for his sister. Guna and his sister visit Sashi at the medical shop Sashi owns. After the visit, Guna is convinced that Sashi is a good man and a perfect match for his sister.
At a dhaba, Sashi and his gang get into a brawl with Radha; they flee when they realise it is Radha. When Sashi learns that Guna has known Radha since childhood, he pleads for Guna’s help. Guna agrees and arranges a meeting with Radha at the granite quarry so that Sashi can apologize to Radha.
Radha arrives alone and viciously slaps Sashi across the face several times as Guna asks Radha to stop. Unbeknownst to Guna or Radha, Sashi’s gang had planned to kill Radha in an ambush. As Sashi's gang holds Guna down, Sashi beheads Radha, and Guna is later jailed for being an accessory to the murder, while Sashi avoids charges.
Guna is shunned by his neighbours when he is released. Guna goes to Geetha’s house and learns she died while he was imprisoned. Her father falsely tells Guna that Geetha renounced their engagement before she died, and stating she did not want to marry a felon. At home, an enraged Guna tells his father that he will take revenge on Radha's real killers. He visits Geetha's house, where he and his family are attacked by Radha’s henchmen. Although Guna prevails, his father is injured and ends up in the hospital. Guna brings Radha's men to Radha’s mother, where he explains to her that he did not kill her son. Radha's mother gives Guna one week to bring Sashi's gang to her.
Guna finds Sashi’s men hiding in a police house and attacks them. Guna calls his father to tell him that he will go back to jail for what he is about to do to the Sashi gang. Battu berates Guna, advising him to hand the killers over to Radha's mother instead.
Guna reveals that the SI said Battu had encouraged Sashi to kill Radha, as Radha humiliated his family; he was the villager whose parents were beaten. Guna says he also learned that Geetha had come to Battu for advice about her father’s insistence to marry someone else. Instead of advising her, Battu and Sashi recorded all of them raping her. Fearing the consequences of the video’s release and the potential for blackmail, Geetha committed suicide.
Forced by Guna, SI films Guna beheading Sashi’s six gang members and dismembering Sashi and Battu. Guna surrenders to the police but is praised for killing the rapists. Guna is eventually released from jail."
587,Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl,"Beginning in Lucknow, 1984, the story begins with young Gunjan Saxena in a flight along with her older brother, Anshuman. Gunjan wants to look out of the airplane window, but Anshuman doesn't let her. A kind air hostess tends to the problem and takes Gunjan to the cockpit. Looking at the cockpit immediately sparks a desire in her mind to become a pilot as she feels enthusiastic about the plane's features.
A few years later, Gunjan is congratulated for her academic excellence with her proud parents, Anup and Kirti, planning to send her to high school. Gunjan, however, wants to drop out of high school to become a pilot. Anshuman feels that women should not be in the cockpit, but in kitchen making food for the family, but Anup strongly disagrees. A firm believer of gender equality, he allows Gunjan to experiment with her desire to become a pilot. Gunjan makes multiple attempts, but these are thwarted by concerns regarding her educational qualifications and high costs, causing her to return home dejected 
each time. While her parents differ in their outlook towards her dream, with Kirti hoping her daughter would soon be wary and Anup insistent on allowing his daughter to pursue her dreams relentlessly, an advertisement in a newspaper for acceptance into the Indian Air Force provides Gunjan just the right opportunity for making an effort to enter the air force. Anshuman, who is himself serving in the army, completely disapproves and tells Gunjan that the Air Force isn't a place for women. She, however, ignores him, and goes ahead with the formalities, later finding out on the day of the results that she is the only female who got accepted.
During her medical tests, Gunjan learns that she is one centimeter too short and seven kilograms too much for the Air Force requirements. She is devastated by this, but learns that she can take a retest in two weeks, and discusses it with Anup, who asks her not to give up, and together they come up with a workout regime to lose weight. Across the retest, she still falls short on the height criterion, but the officers conclude that the length of her hands and legs would compensate for it, and accept her into the force. However, while Anup and Kirti are unable to contain their pride, Anshuman still remains in denial of his sister's dedication, but Gunjan decides to ignore his reservations and commences training. During her training, she finds herself subjected to several harsh realities and inconveniences due to the male-dominated order of the air force, and contemplates leaving the camp, when a crisis situation causes her to reconsider when, in 1999, the Kargil war begins, and all Air Force pilots are needed. Gunjan is determined to take part in the war, and despite Anshuman meeting her and dissuading her from participation, disregards his reservations yet again. She finds herself badly needed in a mission and proceeds with it, but is then ordered to abort because the mission is too difficult for her. She reluctantly resigns to the camp. Suddenly, news of army soldiers being heavily wounded in the battle arrives, and it is up to her to save them.
Gunjan and another pilot take separate helicopters and go over to aid the injured soldiers. Back at the camp, army soldiers ask her to abort the mission but regardless of their opinion, she proceeds. Suddenly, as the other helicopter gets shot down from an RPG attack, Gunjan rescues the other pilot and the wounded soldiers and successfully completes a risky maneuver, despite being exposed to bullets herself. After the mission and the war, she is rewarded for her courage and bravery, with Anup feeling proud of her."

593,Iravukku Aayiram Kangal,"Bharath (Arulnithi) is a taxi driver who is in love with Suseela (Mahima Nambiar), a nurse. He is a fan of writer Vyjayanthi (Lakshmy Ramakrishnan). Once, she rides in his taxi and notices a man and his bike. She tells Bharath that her late husband had the same bike and died, so she is investigating his death. One evening, when Suseela returns from a wedding in a cab, the driver misbehaves with her. Ganesh (Ajmal) saves her, and she thanks him. When they meet again, Ganesh tries to pursue her inappropriately. Ganesh also finds that Suseela is in love with Bharath and warns her to cut off all ties with him. Suseela then meets Bharath and tells him about the problems that Ganesh created, but they find her client Roopala (Chaya Singh) trying to drown herself. They save her, and she tells about her problems with her abusive husband, Vasanth (John Vijay). Also, she inadvertently connected with Ganesh, who films her nude and blackmails her for money. Bharath notices that Ganesh owns the bike that Vyjayanthi had mentioned. Meanwhile, retired businessman Murugesan (Anandaraj) loses money and jewels because of Ganesh.
It is revealed that Ganesh is actually a conman who operates with Anitha (Vidya Pradeep) and Maya (Suja Varunee), and they cheat wealthy people and extort money from them. Murugesan follows Ganesh and finds his address with Narain's (Aadukalam Naren) help. Bharath also finds Ganesh's address and follows him to his house. A neighbor reports the men loitering near the house to the police. When the police arrives to investigate, they learn that Maya is murdered. Bharath is identified as a suspect. He assumes that Murugesan is the killer, but the latter reveals that she was dead before he went into the house. Murugesan also accidentally picked up the murder weapon in a panicked state and left his own gun there. Narain also reveals that he was a victim of Ganesh. Maya had befriended him online, and they were in a relationship when Ganesh threatened both of them at gunpoint and stole Narain's money and car, but the police found the car and returned it to Narain. Narain had been thinking that Maya disappeared from his life, but he saw her with Ganesh. Unable to bear Maya's betrayal, Narain goes to her house to kill her, but he found her dead.
Later, Bharath finds that Vasanth had an affair with Anitha. Ganesh filmed them together and blackmailed him for money. When Vasanth finds that Anitha was part of the scam, Ganesh beats him up. Ganesh blackmails Vasanth about his video with Anitha, but Vasanth does not care. Then, Ganesh blackmails Vasanth with Roopala's nude video, and he gives money. Bharath follows Vasanth, and a fight ensues where the latter kills Anitha and Ganesh. Bharath tells Vasanth that the entire plan to extort money from him was made by Roopala. She wanted to separate from Vasanth and get money from him, so she approached Anitha and Ganesh to help her make a video of Vasanth to blackmail him, and she would then pay them. Ganesh wanted to take the money for himself, so he and Anitha made a nude video of Roopala. Suddenly, Ganesh and Anitha plan to join together and leave Maya out. Maya learns of this, and when she threatens them, Ganesh kills her. Roopala and Vasanth are arrested, and Bharath marries Suseela.
A major twist arrives in the form of Vyjayanthi, who has been following Maya's murder. She calls Bharath, requesting his permission to write a book based on this event. Vyjayanthi narrates a changed plot where Ganesh films Suseela nude and threatens her to marry him. When Bharath discovers this and Roopala's video, he decides to confront Ganesh and erase both videos. Maya learns that Ganesh is after Suseela, so she threatens him to split the shares. If he does not, she will tell Anitha about Suseela. When Bharath and Suseela go to Ganesh's house to retrieve the videos, Maya tries to attack Bharath, but Suseela kills her. Bharath and Suseela erase the videos and leave the crime scene. Bharath finds that Murugesan had taken the murder weapon, so he plants it in Ganesh's car and frames him for Maya's murder.
In the present, Bharath requests Vyjayanthi to find an alternative plot. Later, when he visits her, he finds her murdered, implying that her version of the story may be true. It is left to the audience as to who is Vyjayanthi's murderer."
594,Iruvar,"In the late 1940s, Anandan, an aspiring actor, goes around studios trying to land roles. He meets Tamizhselvan, a rationalist writer he respects, steeped in Dravidian ideas. On the strength of Tamizhselvan's flowery writing and his own impassioned delivery, he is offered the title role in a film.
Tamizhselvan introduces Anandan to Ayya Veluthambi, who leads a Dravidian political party. He grows to like the party's ideology. Anandan marries Pushpavalli, while Tamizhselvan marries Maragatham, from their respective villages. When the two return to Madras, Anandan's film has been cancelled due to financial difficulties and Tamizhselvan's party has become the main opposition party.

Tamizhselvan encourages Anandan to use his popularity to help their party gain more attention. Anandan marries Ramani. Ayya Veluthambi asks Anandan to contest in the upcoming elections, much to the displeasure of Tamizhselvan, who thinks other, more devoted workers deserve the candidacy.
Anandan is shot in neck by a prop gun while filming a scene, but the party sweeps elections, with 152 seats out of 234. Ayya Veluthambi refuses to become chief minister.

Tamizhselvan is resentful that Veluthambi did not involve him, but is chosen to be the chief minister with Anandan's wholehearted support. Anandan later asks to be the health minister, but Tamizhselvan refuses, on the pretext that the executive committee forbids ministers to pursue acting while in office. He offers Anandan any portfolio of his choice on the condition that he suspend his acting career. Anandan does not take it up.
Senthamarai, who had admired Tamizhselvan's daring protests, moves in with him when he writes her a poetic letter and has a daughter with him. Anandan's co-star in his new film is Kalpana who resembles his late wife. While initially distant, Kalpana's chattiness draws Anandan to her. But his indecision about another marriage, Ramani still being his wife, angers Kalpana and she leaves him.
In a memorial function on Ayya Veluthambi's death, Anandan claims party's corruption in governance was the cause of his death. His expulsion by Tamizhselvan splits the party, with several members creating a new one under Anandan's leadership.

Meanwhile, Anandan sees Kalpana at a disaster relief site and asks her to be brought. The car bringing her meets an accident and Kalpana dies.

The movie goes on to narrate the college life with fun and colour. It shows the strength of the friendship and the backgrounds of the friends; most of them are from poor families. Muthu has an aim in his life. Being an athlete, he wants to excel in sports and get a good job through the sports quota to give his poor family a new lease of life. Shobhana, who is from a wealthy family background, feels sympathy for Muthu after she sees the conditions that he and his family live in. She is moved by his perseverance and helps him achieve his goal by encouraging him in every chance. She even advises him that there is more he has to do and be capable of achieving in life, so he should take her encouragements as a way to improve his career and nothing else. But eventually, her encouraging stance turns into some sort of special attachment with him. Slowly, love develops in the minds of both, but they chose to put it on the back seat for the sake of the larger friendship that they share with the group.
Eventually, the friends take a college trip to Andhra. On the way, they stop at a hotel, but there is only non-vegetarian food being served, so Muthu volunteers to run to the nearest vegetarian restaurant a few kilometers away to bring food for Shobhana, who is a vegetarian. Shobhana confessed her love for Muthu to Kayal, which she accepts it wholeheartedly and says that even though she hates the concept of love between best friends, she does not want to spoil Shobhana's happiness and true love. This conversation was overheard by Adhilakshmi. The latter says this to the rest of the gang, to their surprise and delight. Unfortunately, fate has other plans. The hotel they were initially eating at is urgently closed because some politician or another has been arrested.  The group boards the bus urgently and tries to go to a collector's office or police station to keep safe while two classmates wait for Muthu to come back. On the way, however, the bus is stopped by the protestors, and despite pleas to allow them to pass, the protestors light the bus on fire. In a frenzy, everyone tries to evacuate the bus, and Nagarani gets fits. In a scramble to safely get off the bus, the rest of the group fail to realize that some students are still trapped. After the firefighters finish putting out the fire, they bring out the burnt bodies of Kayal, Adhilakshmi and Shobhana, who have embraced each other in their final moments together – Kayal having stayed back to help Shobhana, whose chudi had gotten caught in the bus.
The last scene flashes back to the beginning of the movie, where the group of people were clearing the weeds. It has been eight years since the incident, and every year, the group of friends come to pay respects to their lost friends, and Muthu still keeps  Shobhana's handkerchief in remembrance of their love."
600,Kanche,"In 1936, Dhupati Haribabu and Rachakonda Sitadevi meet at the Madras Cultural Club in Madras Presidency on the latter's birthday and realise that they are studying at the same college, the University of Madras. Sitadevi is the princess of the Rachakonda estate, whereas Haribabu belongs to a lower caste and is the grandson of a local barber. By the time they graduate, they have fallen in love, and leave for their native town, Devarakonda. Haribabu is introduced to Sitadevi's brother Eeswar and they become friends.
Eeswar, and his grandfather Pedababu, learn of Haribabu and Sitadevi's affair and instigate a fight between people of both castes. Hundreds of people from both sides die and a fence (Kanche) is erected to separate the two groups forever. While Eeswar and Pedababu decide to marry off Sitadevi to a boy of their choice, Haribabu arrives back from town and is stabbed. Sitadevi looks after him secretly in her bedroom, and on the wedding day, a frustrated Haribabu marries Sitadevi, in the presence of her grandmother, and leaves. That evening, Eeswar and Haribabu duel, and in the process Sitadevi is killed accidentally.
During World War II, as a member of the allied nations, the British Raj send over two and a half million Indian volunteer soldiers to fight under British command against the Axis powers. Haribabu joins them as a captain and Eeswar, now a colonel, is his commanding officer. In May 1944, the Nazis attack the Indian army in the Italian Campaign, and capture them. Haribabu, his friend Dasu, and three other soldiers escape. They decide to save the captured troops and follow the Nazis. They take shelter in an Italian baker's house and his granddaughter saves them from the Nazis. She reveals that the Nazis want to kill a little girl whose parents were a German doctor and a Jew.
The Nazis find the doctor and a group of civilians, and Haribabu, along with his cohorts, rescues them. The soldiers find the captured troops in an old building and rescue them from the Nazis. When Eeswar asks Haribabu why he saved him despite the rivalry between them, he replies that Sitadevi's love for Eeswar made him do so. They leave with the civilians and find a German base near a river which they can use to escape.
When Haribabu formulates a plan, Eeswar, who still hates him, points out that the plan is flawed. Haribabu reminds him that World War II commenced because of racism and he does not want to see the same bloodshed repeated here that happened in their village. The soldiers raid all the tents and find a boat in which the civilians and the other soldier board. To divert the German army's attention, Haribabu continues to fight alone until the boat reaches safety. Severely injured, Haribabu dies with a smile, thinking of the memories of his life with Sitadevi.
Eeswar is shocked to see Haribabu die and carries his body back to his village. He also reads the letters Haribabu had written to Sitadevi during the war and realises that humans should not be divided by caste. He reaches the village and asks Haribabu's grandfather to dig the grave. Eeswar calls Haribabu a great human, soldier, lover, son and mainly a good friend whom he never recognised. He acknowledges that without the borders of caste, Haribabu would have been happy with Sitadevi and salutes him. Pedababu orders the fences' removal and the people continue to live in peace."
601,Kanneshwara Rama,"Present day
The film starts with Kanneshwara Rama, a long-sought-after fugitive who has been caught by the police. He is being paraded through the streets of Shimoga before being taken to the state capital for his execution. On the way, Rama sees many people in the crowd who have figured in his life at one point or another and starts thinking about those events.
Flashback
Back in his old days, Rama is a hot-headed peasant who fumes at the slightest attempt of intimidation. He despised meekness and that is one of the reasons for his contempt towards his docile wife. Rama defied the village head, resulting in a midnight scuffle in which he ends up killing the person. He is caught and sent to jail.
In prison, Rama meets Mahatma Gandhi’s followers who are political prisoners. Under cover of a nationalistic disturbance, he escapes from the place and joins a group of bandits. The leader of the group is Junja, who zealously guards his gang’s hoard of gold, watched over by Malli, his mistress. Junja gets fond of Rama, something that is resented by some members of the gang, except Chennira who becomes his ally.
Junja is mortally wounded in an encounter with the police and names Rama as his successor. Malli quietly decamps with the hoarded treasure in the dark of night. Rama becomes notorious as an outrageously bold dacoit. He helps the poor, providing a dowry for girls of marriageable age and breaking the hold of feudal landlords in the area. He becomes a hero in the eyes of the people, attaining a status akin to Robinhood.
He raids a landlord’s safe and accidentally finds refuge in Malli’s house. She is now a high-priced prostitute and they become lovers. However, Rama finds an opportunity to steal her jewels and does not hesitate.
Rama’s daring exploits, his growing popularity, and his successes begin to worry the government. The tension with the police reaches its peak when he rescues a group of nationalists from the police, takes the policemen captive, and humiliates the British Captain. He is both amused and impressed by Gandhi’s policy of non-violence, but what catches his attention is their building of a cause and the symbolic flag, an idea that started to germinate in his mind.
Some members of Rama’s gang are disloyal to him. He out-maneuvers them in their break-away attempt to rob an armed treasury and forgives the culprits, against Chennira’s advice. However, Rama begins to wonder whether any group can be loyal to an individual for long. He feels that the guiding principle should be an idea, symbolized by a flag and a base, both of which are necessary. He frees a village under the bondage to a religious order, adopts it, and places his flag on an old fort that guards it. Rama becomes a legend, carving out an independent principality of his own. Rama becomes a legend in his own lifetime. Ballad singers compose songs praising his courage and the police are afraid of him.
The British Government is alarmed. The District Collector sends a large force to capture Rama at any cost. The Police Superintendent first tries to cajole Malli into giving him away but she refuses to do their bidding. He then threatens the people in the village and takes some hostages. The police offensive against Rama is intensified. At an encounter, most of his gang is killed, including the trusted Chennira. Rama runs to his villagers for refuge but they are too scared to help him. Enraged, he sets the village on fire. Even Malli is not able to deter him. The Police Superintendent tries to make Malli help him again. At first, she refuses but when the relatives of the hostages plead with her, she agrees.
Present day
Rama is now alone and helpless. He abandons his weapons at the altar of a temple and visits Malli at night. A trap is set around her house and as soon as Malli sends a signal, the police surround the area. Malli defends her actions by saying that his vindictiveness drove her to it.  He says he had only come to give her his treasures so that they could be given to the villagers as compensation. Malli now regrets her betrayal but it is too late."
602,Kappalottiya Thamizhan,"V. O. Chidambaram Pillai has devoted himself to the cause of India's freedom from the British Raj. Chidambaram, appearing for the peasant Madasami, wins a case filed by an agent of a British proprietor. Chidambaram's father, who appeared for the agent, sends his son to Thoothukudi lest the British proprietor should give him any trouble. Madasami who accompanies Chidambaram, looks after the latter's salt-pan. At Thoothukudi, Chidambaram meets Subramaniya Siva, a freedom fighter and works for the Swadeshi movement.
Chidambaram receives a complaint from some of the local merchants that the British Shipping Company had refused to load their goods. Against great odds, Chidambaram starts the National Shipping Company with Indian Capital to free Indian trade from dependence on foreign liners. The company prospers despite attempts by the British Company to sabotage the ship of the Indian firm. Chidambaram incurs the displeasure of the Government by organising a strike for getting the grievances of the local coral mill workers redressed and by organising public celebrations to mark the release of Bipin Chandra Pal in contravention of a prohibitory order.
Chidambaram, along with Siva, is invited to Tirunelveli by the District Collector, Winch. The collector directs them not to engage in political activity and also orders them out of the District. They defy the orders and are arrested. In the trial which ensues, Chidambaram is sentenced to 20 years life imprisonment and Siva to 10 years. Chidambaram's sentence is reduced to six years on appeal. The imprisonment of these two leaders sparks off mass unrest which is put down ruthlessly. Some time later, the new District Collector Ashe is shot dead by a patriotic Vanchinathan, who commits suicide before the police can reach him.
The news of the unrelenting struggle outside gives much consolation to Chidambaram and Siva who are treated barbarously in the prison. Chidambaram emerges from the prison a broken man only to witness a series of disappointments – Chidambaram's brother has become insane, Siva is a victim of leprosy contracted during his term in prison, people have forgotten him and his role in the Indian independence movement, the National Shipping Company is bought by its British rival and leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bharathiyar die one after another. Chidambaram devotes the last years of his life to the study of literature and dies still dreaming of the day when India would be free."
603,Karaikkal Ammaiyar (1973 film),"Punithavathi (Lakshmi), right from childhood, had great faith in Lord Shiva and worshipped him daily. As a young girl, she built a Sivalingam in sand, stunning people. Her father Dhanathatthan (V. S. Raghavan) was a Merchant. As a young girl, She chanted Namshivaya Mantra of Lord Shiva several times daily, and took care of devotees of Shiva coming to her village. Later, she was married to Paramathathan (R. Muthuraman) son of a wealthy merchant from Nagapattinam. A devotee of Lord Shiva continued to visit her home, whom she lavishly fed and gave clothes to. Once, her husband sent her two mangoes to be kept for him. That day, a hungry Siva devotee came to her residence. Punithavathi gave the guest Curd rice and one of the mangoes. Later, when the husband came home she served a mango, he asked for the second. She was at a loss and prayed to Lord Shiva (Sivakumar). Suddenly, a mango appeared in her hands. She served the mango to her husband, who found it divinely delicious compared to the previous one and asked her how she got the second fruit. Since he was not religious, she was scared of revealing the truth. He began suspecting her and asked her to get another fruit. She gave him a mango that she got by prayer, the fruit disappeared when he touched it. He realised that his wife was no ordinary woman.
But she was a divine person and he began to call her ""Ammaiyar"". As he could no longer treat her as his wife, he left her and moved to Madurai, where he married another woman named Bhakyavathi (Kumari Padmini), through whom he had child. They named her also Punithavathi (Baby Sumathi). Ammaiyar prayed to Lord Shiva asking for a boon—that she may worship Shiva as a disembodied wraith. Her wish was granted, leaving all her beauty and bodily being. She then took on different form (K. B. Sundarambal). She became a fiery form of Mount Kailash, climbing it upside down on her head. There, the Goddess Parvati (Srividya) asked about Ammaiyar. Shiva said that Ammaiyar is the mother, who takes care of us. Ammaiyar worshiped Shiva. Shiva greeted her, calling her ""Ammaiyae"" (my mother) and Ammaiyar replied ""Appa"" (father to all). Shiva asked for her wish, to which Ammaiyar replied ""I want endless and delightful love with you, I don't want to be born, Even if I have any birth, I should not forgot you"". Shiva asked her to visit him in Thiruvalangadu, which she again did, travelling on her hands and sang and performed a holy dance (Rudhra Thandavam). Ammaiyar visited Thiruvalangadu. Ammaiyar sang ""Thiruvaalangattu mootha Thirupathigam""."

The film goes into flashback mode, and John is shown to be an assassin working for a mobster named Captain (Bharat Dabholkar). Accompanied by two friends Kaif (Murali Sharma) and Bull (Rajesh Khera), he is assigned a hit, which he carries out, but also ends up killing an entire family, who arrives untimely to the house from where the hit was planned. Apart from the adults, one of their daughters gets shot unintentionally by John. He gets traumatized, and despite his friends telling him to move on, he becomes guilt-ridden and explains everything to Shalini, with whom he plans to escape away. The city's toughest cop, Wagh (Shiney Ahuja), starts investigating the murder and, in the process, comes close to the surviving daughter of the deceased family.

605,Karnan (2021 film),"In Southern Tamil Nadu, two neighbouring villages Melur and Podiyankulam in Tirunelveli find themselves in constant conflict as the latter is denied a bus stop. Podiyankulam's inhabitants, who belong to the oppressed communities, are forced to use the bus stop of Melur for commuting, which irks the locals who belong to the dominant castes. Despite multiple petitions, Podiyankulam is constantly denied a bus stop thanks to the influence of Melur's local government. In 1997, Karnan, who is from Podiyankulam wins the local deity's sword as part of a competition, which had not been won for years. Weeks later, Karnan participates in an open selection camp for Reserve Police, where his grandfather Yaema Raja is worried that Karnan would lose the opportunity to join government service, if his hot-headedness would involve him in any legal trouble with the Melur villagers and is constantly looking out for him. 
Within Podiyankulam, Karnan and Yaeman are considered unruly by many except its chieftain Duryodhanan, who befriends them both. This does not sit well with Vadamaalaiyan, one of the village's heads who desires to marry Karnan's sister Padmini, who is far younger than him. Vadamaalaiyan's sister Draupadhi, who is in love with Karnan, misunderstands the situation during the latter's brawl with her brother and breaks up with him. Meanwhile, tensions escalate between Melur and Podiyankulam, as Karnan along with his friends and Yaema Raja vandalises a bus for not stopping by to help a pregnant lady. The bus owner files a complaint with the police and the district's SP Kannabiran arrives on the scene. Despite being an IPS officer, Kannabiran thinks that caste superiority is correct and natural, and he belongs to the community which is the dominant one in Melur. 
Though the bus owner and Podiyankulam's residents settle the issue amicably, the incident bruises Kannabiran's ego who feels that the villagers must always be shown their place. He asks Podiyankulam's village heads to come and sign at the area police station, only to brutally assault them for an hour and lock them up overnight. He insults them verbally and orders local police to file unrelated cases on them. Next day early morning, Karnan and others arrive to the Station and enquire about the elders. The police feign ignorance and send them out. The helper boy in the tea shop outside tells Karnan about the incidents of previous night, and Karnan storms into the Station. The guys fight off the police, find the elders on rooftop under burning sun and take them home using a confiscated tractor. Podiyankulam barriacades itself and prepares for a police attack to face the consequences of Karnan's actions. 
However, the District Collector warns Kannabiran to avoid casualties at all costs. Draupadhi and Vadamaalaiyan settle their issues with Karnan, and Yaema Raja works on providing security to the villagers. However, Karnan receives his appointment letter from CRPF. He refuses to leave, but is forced to leave by Yaema Raja and the villagers, to have a better future. Minutes after Karnan leaves, the police brutally attack the village. To save his community, Yaema Raja kills himself by self-immolation, and Karnan is forced to return with sword in hand. He and Kannabiran face each other, and he traps him using the sword. He takes him hostage inside a hut, ending the clash. Karnan orders the police to bring in the MP, MLA and all important officers within an hour. Inside the hut, Kannabiran and Karnan fight, ending with Karnan overpowering Kannabiran for good. 
Kannabiran again exhalts his caste pride and predicts that Karnan's village will be soon destroyed due to his actions. Enraged, Karnan decapitates Kannabiran, and he is arrested. Karnan is released from prison after ten years. The village Podiyankulam has gotten a bus stop, many of the village youths are now educated, but most of the older village heads succumbed to medical issues caused as aftermath of the police brutality, Padmini is married and the village's community hall has a picture of Yaema Raja painted on a huge wall.

607,Kesari (2019 film),"Ishar Singh is a havildar in the Sikh Regiment of the British Indian Army. His superior and commander is an arrogant British officer, who deems all Indians to be cowards, and is jealous of Ishar Singh because of his superior fighting skills.
The regiment is posted at Gulistan Fort, on the border between British-held territory and the Afghan border. Once, while on a border patrol, the troops see a group of Afghan tribesmen, led by one Saidullah, on the verge of killing a married Afghan woman because she refuses to accept her husband, who has been chosen by her family without her consent. The British officer refuses to intervene and save the woman for two reasons: firstly, she is an Afghan citizen and does not reside in British territory; and secondly, it is a family matter pertaining to tribal custom, and the policy of the British Raj is to not interfere in such matters. In defiance of the orders of his officer, Ishar Singh goes ahead and intervenes, fights off the tribesmen, and rescues the woman by killing her husband, thereby disobeying his immediate superior.
When the troops return to Gulistan fort, the British officer writes a strong report informing his commanding officer, who sits at the nearby Lockhart fort, of Ishar Singh's disobedience and insubordination. Soon enough, the Afghans attack the British-controlled Gulistan fort, but are held at bay by Ishar Singh who fights valiantly, killing many Afghans. Nevertheless, Ishar Singh is blamed by his superiors for his actions which caused the breach of peace with the Afghans. He is given a punishment transfer to Saragarhi fort, which sits between Gulistan and Lockhart forts, and enables communication between them. Ishar Singh duly travels to Saragarhi fort. Upon arriving there, he finds the troop in a mess. He enforces discipline by punishing all to live without food for an entire week. The troops are furious at first, but later begins to respect Ishar Singh after learning that he too was living without food. Meanwhile, Saidullah forms an alliance between the Afghan tribes and motivates them to mount an attack on British territories as a unified force. Ishar Singh and Lal Singh go to a nearby village in search of their informant who hadn't reported to them for over three days.
The British Commanding Officer Col. John Haughton from Lockhart fort sees the Afghan Forces marching towards Sargarhi and alerts Ishar. Ishar and his battalion sees ten thousand tribesmen approaching and encircling the fort. Saidullah, with the entire Afghan army at his back, kills the woman Ishar Singh had rescued earlier in front of the Saragarhi Fort. Despite the commanding officer's orders to abandon the fort and flee, Ishar Singh and his men decide to fight till their death. Ishar Singh deploys his force in position. Khuda Daad volunteers to fight but Ishar Singh asks him to instead provide water to the injured soldiers (Including the Afghans). The Afghans initiate the battle, and Bhagwan Singh is the first to be killed. Gurmukh Singh, being an inexperienced soldier, is unable to fight, due to which Ishar Singh asks him to keep the CO updated regarding the battle, and decides to prolong the battle so as to prevent the Afghans from advancing to the Gulistan and Lockhart forts. As the battle prolongs, Lal Singh alone fights the Afghans outside the fort and dies while asking one of the sepoys to close the gate to the fort. Meanwhile, the Afghans manage to destroy the back wall of the fort using explosives.
Ishar Singh remembers his wife Jeevani one last time after removing the stripes from his uniform and starts fighting the Afghans with a red-hot sword before he gets fatally stabbed. Saidullah kills Khuda Daad before himself being stabbed to death by Ishar while trying to remove his turban. Ishar's bravery impresses an Afghan chieftain who orders his men not to touch any Sikh's turban. One of the Afghan chieftains named Gul Badshah, orders the signaling post to be lit up so Gurmukh Singh's painful screams can be heard as a consolation. As the Afghans set the post on fire, Gurmukh Singh emerges with his body on fire. He chants ""Bole So Nihal, Sat Sri Akaal"" thrice, grabs Gul Badshah and triggers the grenades attached to his body, resulting in a huge explosion. The shout echoes and reaches both the nearby forts. The Sikh soldiers present there also start chanting in the name of their Guru. The surviving Afghans loot the fort and eventually set it on fire. The British Parliament honours the fallen with a two-minute silence and posthumously awards them the British Order of Merit - the highest gallantry award an Indian soldier could receive."

At the age of 12, Bhagat takes a solemn vow to free India from the British Raj after witnessing the aftermath of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Soon after the massacre, he learns of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's satyagraha policies and begins to support the non-cooperation movement, in which thousands of people burn British-made clothing and abandon school, college studies, and government jobs. In February 1922, Gandhi calls off the movement after the Chauri Chaura incident. Feeling betrayed by Gandhi, Bhagat decides to become a revolutionary, and, as an adult, joins the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) in its struggle for India's independence, ending up in prison for his activities. Singh's father, Kishen, bails him out on a fee of ₹60,000 so that he can get him to run a dairy farm and marry a girl named Mannewali. Bhagat runs away from home, leaving a note saying that his love for the country comes first.
When Lala Lajpat Rai is beaten (lathi charged) to death by the police while protesting against the Simon Commission, Bhagat, along with Shivram Hari Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar and Chandra Shekhar Azad, assassinate John P. Saunders (in mistaken for James A. Scott who ordered to beat Lalaji), a British police officer, on 17 December 1928. Later on in the year 1929, when the British propose the Trade Disputes and Public Safety Bills, Bhagat, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, initiate a bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly. He and Dutt throw the bombs on empty benches due to their intention to avoid causing casualties. They are subsequently arrested and tried publicly. Bhagat then gives a speech about his ideas of revolution, stating that he wanted to tell the world about the freedom fighters himself rather than let the British misrepresent them as violent people, citing this as the reason for bombing the assembly. Bhagat soon becomes more popular than Gandhi among the Indian populace, in particular the younger generation, laborers and farmers.
In Lahore Central Jail, Bhagat and all of the other fellow prisoners, including Sukhdev and Rajguru, undertake a 116-day hunger strike to improve the conditions of Indian political prisoners. On the 63rd day, one of Bhagat's partners Jatin Das, dies in the police custody as he could not bear the hunger anymore.

The police surround the entire park leading to a shootout; refusing to be captured by the British, Azad commits suicide with the last remaining bullet in his Colt pistol.
Fearing the growing popularity of the hunger strike amongst the Indian public nationwide, Lord Irwin (the Viceroy of British India) orders the re-opening of the Saunders' murder case, which leads to capital death sentences being imposed on Bhagat, Sukhdev and Rajguru. The Indians hope that Gandhi will use his pact with Irwin as an opportunity to save Bhagat, Sukhdev and Rajguru's lives. Irwin refuses Gandhi's request for their release. Gandhi reluctantly agrees to sign a pact which includes the clause: ""Release of political prisoners except for the ones involved in violence"".

622,Major (film),"The movie starts with Sandeep Unnikrishnan entering the POK, which the Pakistani Army considers a threat and orders him to retreat. When questioned by the Indian Army Officials on why he did it and that the area belongs to Pakistan, he replies ""It is ours"". Young Sandeep grows up with his sister, Sandhya, and his parents K. Unnikrishnan and Dhanalakshmi, in Yelahanka, Bangalore. As a child, he was very curious about the world around him. When Unnikrishnan took him to see a Navy ceremony with military airplanes flying in the sky Sandeep developed an early fascination with the life of a soldier. In his later years as a secondary school student, Sandeep falls in love with his classmate, Isha. Sandeep applied to join the Indian Navy without telling his parents, much to the fury of Unnikrishnan. However, the Navy ultimately rejected Sandeep's application, causing Sandeep to ultimately join the army. As the years progressed Sandeep rose up the ranks to become an NSG training officer.
In 2008, Sandeep is well established in his career as a training officer for the 51 Special Action Group of the NSG and is married to Isha, but their marriage is in trouble. Sandeep asks for leave to try and save his marriage. On the same day as Sandeep's leave though, Pakistani terrorists arrive in Mumbai by boat and they proceed to orchestrate deadly attacks in the city. Desperately crowds start heading to the Taj Hotel for safety but the terrorists also enter the hotel and start shooting at staff and guests indiscriminately. The local police are called to the scene but they are ill-equipped to deal with the threat. Upon discovering the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, Sandeep requests Commander Shera to allow him to participate in the NSG mission to neutralize the terrorist threat. They leave for Mumbai and commence the military counterterrorism operation: Operation Black Tornado, but the NSG encounters a vast number of obstacles and problems upon arriving at the scene. They lack surveillance cameras to discover the number of people inside the building. 
The terrorists have installed deadly booby traps and trip wires with bombs throughout the premises. Several hotel staff and guests end up crowded together in a locked room, all bound and gagged on the floor. To make matters worse there is an intrusive media circus swarming outside the hotel reporting the NSG's known operations and movements, information which ultimately proves useful to the terrorists. Meanwhile, a guest named Pramoda Reddy, who is trapped on the fifth floor, manages to keep herself hidden from the gunmen. She ultimately takes responsibility to rescue British tourist's young daughter, named Shirley. Sandeep talks to Isha over the phone. She is applying for divorce and scolds Sandeep for not being there with her when she had a miscarriage, but she is horrified when she discovers that Sandeep is at the Taj Hotel. As the NSG rescue more hostages (several of whom remain tied up inside a locked banquet hall) and starts closing in on the remaining terrorists, Pramoda calls the downstairs lobby using a walkie-talkie from one of the dead security guards. 
Sandeep ultimately decides to go to the 5th floor to save them, saying that he would never be able to forgive himself if he did not save her. His colleagues subsequently use tear gas and Sandeep races up to the 5th floor. He ultimately rescues Pramoda and Shirley and heroically kills some of the terrorists. However, when his CO asks him whether he needs reinforcement or not, he refuses. His last words are ""Do not come up, I will handle them."" But as fate would have it, he is killed in action, laying down his life for his country. Major Sandeep's parents watch in horror as the news coverage shows that Sandeep was killed in action. They had thought that since Sandeep was a training officer he was not involved in the rescue mission at the Taj Hotel. After his death, there is a large military funeral and a crowd of well-wishers gather to mourn Sandeep's passing. Isha is devastated at Sandeep's death and discovers that he never signed the divorce papers. Later, a 10-year commemoration ceremony in 2018 honoring the lives taken during the attack is held at the Taj Hotel. During the commemorations, Pramoda is reunited with the Shirley whose life she had saved. Mr. Unnikrishnan gives an impassioned speech in which he says that Sandeep should be remembered not for how he died, but for how he lived. 
As Unnikrishnan recalls during his speech, a flashback shows the continuation of the beginning of the movie. It is shown that Sandeep was playing cricket with the children from Pakistan, and when he was called back, he waves goodbye and promises the children that he would come to play another time."

Later Nakulan falls in love with Ganga and they get married. Sreedevi is also married, but her marriage ends up in a divorce.
In the present day, Ganga and Nakulan arrive at their hometown from Kolkata. Thampi learns that Nakulan has decided to stay at the family mansion named Madampalli, despite all attempts to dissuade them. The couple moves in with the help of the family including Thampi's wife and children, Thampi's sister Bhasura, her husband Unnithan, and their daughter Alli.
Later Bhasura reveals the reason why everyone fears the mansion. About 150 years ago, Sankaran Thambi Karanavar, the then head of the family traveled to Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, where he met and fell for a dancer named Nagavalli. However, she did not reciprocate his feelings as she was already in love with another dancer named Ramanathan. As a result, Karanavar took her back to his palace by force. Unknown to him, Nagavalli made Ramanathan stay in a cottage next to the palace and met him secretly. When Karanavar discovered this, he slew Nagavalli on a Durgashtami night in her room named Thekkini situated at the southwest corner of the house. Nagavalli's ghost tried to take her revenge. Karanavar with the help of various priests and sorcerers tamed the ghost by locking it up in the same room. The Karanavar too commits suicide shortly afterward.
In the present day, Alli and Mahadevan (a college professor) are in love, and their marriage is fixed. Listening to Nagavalli's story, Ganga thinks that it was fabricated to scare thieves from stealing treasures in the room. So, Ganga gets the room key's duplicate from Alli and opens the room. She is scolded by Sreedevi, for the locksmith and the man who gave the key to Alli, have both been bedridden.
Subsequently, strange things begin to happen in the household; apparitions of a woman frighten the people in the house, things inexplicably break, and Ganga's sari catches fire during the day. The needle of suspicion falls on Sreedevi, who is generally found to be gloomy. Nakulan immediately calls up his psychiatrist friend Dr. Sunny from the United States to solve the case. As soon as Sunny arrives, an unknown person tries to kill Alli by locking her up in a storeroom.
Sunny also uncovers other incidents such as an attempt to kill Nakulan by poisoning, as well as a mysterious voice singing from upstairs during the night.
Ganga mysteriously disappears during a Kathakali Night. Sunny notices her absence and searches for her, and with Nakulan's help finds Ganga, who is apparently being harassed by Mahadevan.
After the confusions settle, Sunny reveals to Mahadevan and Nakulan that all the problems in the house are orchestrated by Ganga, who suffers from split personality disorder. Sunny tells them that Ganga who frequently transforms into Nagavalli's personality tried to kill Alli and Nakulan (who impersonates the Karanavar) and frame Mahadevan for sexual harassment by Nagavalli's alter ego. Mahadevan impersonates her lover Ramanathan since the former stays at the same house Ramanathan did. By framing Mahadevan, Ganga's alter ego planned to stop his marriage to Alli and get him back. Now the only way to stop Nagavalli's influence on Ganga is to make her believe that she killed her enemy Karanavar on Durgashtami.
Thampi calls in a renowned tantric expert, Brahmadathan Namboothiripad to solve the family's menace. To everyone's surprise, Sunny and Brahmadathan are long-time friends and they discuss the matter deeply as Sunny makes a rather unconventional plan to cure Ganga. Before carrying out his plan, Sunny asks Nakulan to provoke Ganga to see for himself whether she turns into the Nagavalli spilt persona or not. When Nakulan does so, she transforms into her Nagavalli persona, which shocks him. A worried Nakulan shouts at Ganga, turning her back to normal.
On Durgashtami night, Sunny and Brahmadathan allow Nagavalli to behead Nakulan posing as the Karanavar. Brahmadathan suddenly blows smoke and ash on Ganga's face when she is given a sword to kill Nakulan. Simultaneously Sunny turns a part of the platform over to let Nakulan escape, and a lifeless dummy of the Karanavar gets sliced instead. Convinced that her enemy is dead, Nagavalli leaves Ganga's body, permanently curing her.
The family bids farewell to Ganga, Nakulan, and Sunny. Sunny expresses his desire to marry Sreedevi before leaving."

They are both acquitted from the charge of obscenity for their respective works. Manto has many admirers and friends in the film industry. The closest is Shyam Chadda, a charming budding actor and Ashok Kumar, a famous actor, director and producer. But, his biggest supporter and the unwavering pillar of strength is his wife, Safia.

642,Narappa,"In the 1980s Anantapur district, a man and a boy are trekking across a river, carrying homemade bombs. In another part of the village, a woman, a man, and a young girl are also hiding from the police.
The narrator reveals in a flashback that the man is Narappa and the boy is his son Seenappa. The woman, man, and child are Narappa's wife, Sundaramma, her brother Basavaiah and daughter Bujjamma. They also had an older son called Munikanna. They are a family of farmers living in Ramasagaram. Narappa has a close relationship with his older son but is distant, almost abusive with Seenappa. Narappa is from a family of farmers.
Panduswamy is a landlord from Vadakoor (lit. northern village), who plans a cement factory with his youngest son Doraswamy and they need Narappa's 3 acres of land, which the family is against selling, especially Munikanna. One day Sundaramma is attacked by Panduswamy's son Rangababu, to which Munikanna retaliates by severely injuring him and gets imprisoned. Consequently, Narappa pleads with Panduswamy to get Munikanna released, and he asks Narappa to prostrate before every male resident of the landlord's village as atonement. Being cognizant of it, Munikanna beats Panduswamy with a slipper. As revenge, Panduswamy's henchmen, led by a hunter Gampanna, behead Munikanna. Sundaramma is heartbroken, and after a year, Seenappa is compelled to kill Panduswamy in revenge. Narappa witnesses the attack and flees with his family.
The film returns to the present. Gampanna is ordered by Doraswamy & Rangababu to find the pair. He tracks them down and almost kills Seenappa. Narappa defeats them all and when they recover, Narappa explains why he spared their lives.
Twenty years earlier, he is a village-famous moonshine brewer and trusted servant to Shankaraiah, a landlord. One day, he convinces his employer to employ Seenu, Shankaraiah's distant relative, as a clerk. Narappa's brother Munnappa and Varadarajulu, a lawyer, are attempting to regain their poor farming community's land from landlords who had seized it illegally. Narappa's family repeatedly fails to find a bride for him as he is a brewer. Frustrated Narappa's elder sister's daughter Kannamma, proposes to her uncle which he and the family accepts. Seenu slowly gains Shankaraiah's trust and becomes his mill accountant. Once Narappa beats Seenu inside the mill, for refusing to loan Rs. 1 to him and he plans revenge. Meanwhile, Narappa gifts sandals to Kannamma. Noticing Kannamma wearing sandals, Seenu hits her and forces her to walk through the village with the sandals on her head. Narappa retaliates by hitting him with sandals in the middle of the village and ties him up but is reprimanded by Shankaraiah. Humiliated Narapppa quits brewing and joins his brother. One night, before a meeting is conducted by Munnappa and Narappa, the news arrives that Varadarajulu is arrested, and Narappa is sent to get the documents authorizing the meeting. When he returns, Munappa has been killed by Seenu and Narappa's entire family is burned alive in their huts along with Kannamma. Enraged, Narappa brutally kills Shankaraiah, Seenu, and their men.
After that, Narappa leaves the village and months later is found by Basavaiah, who taught him farming. He's also introduced to Sundaramma, who is not getting marriage proposals. Then, he narrates his story, and Sundaramma admires what he did for his family. He surrenders to the court and is given a short-term penalty. After serving his sentence he marries Sundaramma. Seenappa is amazed at his father's past and starts to admire him. Narappa reconciles with his wife and reaches Varadarajulu for help who advises them to turn up to court the next day.
Doraswamy and Rangababu plan an ambush near the court premises and Narappa and his son flee. Later Narappa reluctantly sells his land to protect Seenappa from  Panduswamy's family. However, Seenappa is abducted and tortured by Doraswamy & Rangababu, in direct violation of the agreement. At this point, the infuriated Narappa kills them and many of their henchmen. He and Seenappa sustain serious injuries. Basavaiah and their villagers arrive armed and defuse the situation.
In the end, it is revealed that the two villages agreed that the conflict should end and prevent a village clash. Narappa's family has gathered in the court, and he has agreed to go to jail instead of Seenappa if necessary. He tells his son to study well and get a job, and that, unlike land and money, the landlords can't seize their education. The film ends with Narappa smiling at his family as he enters the court."

646,Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai,"The film opens in March 1993 in Bombay, with a suicide attempt by ACP Agnel Wilson on the pretext of the recent Bombay bombings. When questioned by his superior over his actions, he breaks down and claims that the bombings are his own fault. Wilson recounts that 18 years ago, when he was posted as the ACP in the Bombay crime branch, his inability to take necessary action led to the rise of Shoaib Khan, a dreaded gangster who played a central role in the bombings.
Throughout the film, Wilson narrates the story of 1970s Bombay, when it was ruled by a kind-hearted smuggler Sultan Mirza, and how Mirza's eventual downfall led to Shoaib's rise to power.
After being hit by a flood in his hometown of Madras, a young Mirza arrives in Bombay, where he lands a job as a coal shoveller near the docks. Despite his meagre earnings, Mirza never fails to help the poor and needy, which soon gains him their respect and admiration. Mirza has thus been given the nickname Sultan.
As a grown man, Sultan Mirza becomes the kingpin of Bombay's smuggling underworld in the '70s. Through his influence, Mirza peacefully divides the city among four gangsters, thus thwarting police efforts to curb illegal activities. Despite being a criminal, Sultan Mirza is portrayed as a man of principle with a heart of gold and a godfather-like figure to the people, even going to the extent of refraining from smuggling contraband as it is against his Muslim faith.
Meanwhile, Shoaib is even in childhood a very ambitious person with a dark and daring character, who is frequently involved in petty theft. His father, Hussain Khan, who is a Sub-Inspector with the Bombay Police, tries in vain to guide and control his son; his anger against Shoaib began years ago when Shoaib and his best friend Javed were stealing money and got caught red handed by a man, by teaching his son a lesson, Hussain slapped him 5 times. Hussain locks Shoaib in jail, but Shoaib angers him as both Shoaib and Wilson make a deal saying that Shoaib wants to follow another path. Worried, Hussain turns to Sultan for help. Sultan agrees and helps the young man set up an electronics shop. But Shoaib is unsatisfied, as his only real ambition is to become rich and powerful, like Sultan, who is his idol.
Mirza has a crush on actress Rehana and the two eventually begin dating. Sultan invests black money in her upcoming films. Wilson moves to stop Rehana's films funded by Sultan. Later, Sultan and Rehana frame Wilson to make it look as if Wilson is accepting a bribe, which damages his credibility.
Shoaib's beautiful girlfriend, Mumtaz, works in a local jewellery shop, which Shoaib visits often, to the aggravation of her boss. Shoaib gives her a beautiful necklace, which, unbeknownst to Mumtaz, Shoaib had stolen from a lady during a home robbery. Later, that lady comes to the shop with her husband to buy more jewellery. The lady soon recognizes her own necklace being worn by Mumtaz and accuses her of allegedly stealing her jewellery and publicly insults her. Following this, Mumtaz admits to the outraged customer that her boyfriend had given the item to her. The lady and her husband demand she takes them to her boyfriend's shop, where they confront him. This enrages Shoaib, who beats up the husband and destroys his own shop.
Shoaib goes to Sultan and asks to be a part of his crime ring. Seeing his potential, Sultan agrees to take him under his wing. Shoaib learns the tricks of the trade and soon becomes Sultan's trusted aide. Wilson hatches a plan to use Shoaib's reckless ambition for quick money and power as a way to cause the downfall of Sultan. Wilson even refrains from killing Sultan and Shoaib when he has the opportunity, however Wilson's plan backfires. Finally, when Shoaib becomes invincible, Wilson blames himself for the subsequent catastrophe as he now cannot stop Shoaib's rise to power.
In 1975, Sultan decides to hand over his power to Shoaib, and opts to enter state politics. He travels to Delhi to meet the Home Minister of India Jeet Kumar Rathi. Shoaib's unscrupulous ambitions lead him to carry out trades and acts which Sultan himself would strongly condemn and abhor, including manufacturing illicit liquor, accepting contract killings, investing in drug peddling, and running extortion rackets. When Sultan returns to Bombay, he learns of Shoaib's misdeeds and is outraged. He finds Shoaib at a party and slaps him in public for his unethical activities and states he can never really be like Sultan. This infuriates Shoaib and he plots his revenge as he now knows that Sultan and he cannot possibly rule Bombay together due to Sultan's strong principles and moral ethos. The next day, as Sultan campaigns for his new party, Shoaib appears and assassinates Sultan while he is addressing the people at the rally as a horrified Wilson looks on, thus ending the reign of the smuggler who was loved by his people.
Back in 1993, Wilson laments that he and the police are responsible for the bombings because of their lack of forethought. Wilson also says that 18 years later, Shoaib now rules Bombay despite living abroad, and the people are now forever at his mercy. As Bombay's new underworld kingpin, he has since established a global smuggling empire, which leaves any and all governments and forces no chance to reach him."

652,Payanam (2011 film),"On a flight from Chennai to Delhi, five passengers retrieve weapons hidden in the toilet and use them to hijack the plane. An engine is damaged during the struggle with the pilots, so they make an emergency landing at Tirupati Airport. Government authorities arrive. The hijacker demanded ₹100 Crore (c. US $22,000,000), the release of their imprisoned leader Yusuf Khan, and a fresh aircraft for their escape.
National Security Guard Major N. Raveendran (Major N. Raveendra in Telugu) recalls the loss of a valued comrade at the shootout when he captured Yusuf Khan and regrets not killing Khan at the time. He urges the government to allow a commando operation, but officials fear risking passengers' life, not trusting Raveendra's team. The major is frustrated when the government vacillates, and it seems Khan might be released. Inside the flight, the passengers fall into groups discussing their past lives and religion. One of the terrorists becomes sentimentally attached to Afshana, a little girl returning to Karachi after her heart operation. The terrorist, however, is warned by his comrade to not become too attached as his main duty is to carry out the current tasks, which include killing the passengers, in the end, no matter what. Another passenger frequently irritates the terrorists with bitter questions about their motives, which he is supported by Jagdeesh, a retired army colonel. Time passes, and tensions rise until one of the passengers, Praveen (a drug addict), attempts an escape but is shot down by a terrorist who warns the authorities to act soon.
Ravindra's colleague Nawaz Khan discovers that the missing cleaner who prepared the toilet of the flight before its departure has been identified by Tamil Nadu Police.

After a chase in Red Hills, they capture the man, who confesses his involvement in the plot and also gives vague information about the size of the weapon he placed in the toilet. Ravi and Nawaz deduce that it must be a plastic explosive.
On his return, Ravi is told the government has decided to release Khan. But Khan dies in an accident while being transported to the airport. Ravi asks the officials to be very confident about this information so they can plan an assault without the terrorists' knowledge. However, a reporter disguises himself as an assistant to a senior police official, and so gets close to the aircraft. He records footage of the flight through his pen camera and overhears two officials talking about the accident of Khan in the restroom. The terrorists get alarmed. Despite attempts to contain the news, the media leak it, and one of the terrorists kills the passenger Subash, seeking proof that Yusuf is alive, failing which one passenger will be killed every half an hour. Ravi later arranges for Ranganathan, who acted as Khan in a film, to pose as the real Khan, to make the terrorists believe Khan is alive and getting treated at a hospital.
Meanwhile, Ravi plans an operation to rescue the victims and names it Operation Garuda. Through a cleaning lady, he secretly sends a mobile phone onto the plane in a food packet, so he can exchange information with Colonel Jagadeesh. Ravi plans to shoot the terrorists during their transit to a new flight by asking the passengers to bend down when they get a signal. The firing succeeds, and four of the five terrorists are killed. The last terrorist is killed with the help of the passengers Chandrakanth and Vinod. The plastic explosive is found in Afshana's bag. Ravi throws it away, which explodes. The operation ends with the Prime Minister appreciating Ravi and the passengers heading to their destination.
The passengers happily take leave and farewell each other and agree to meet again. The terrorists' names are revealed to be Yasin (the leader), Munna, Omar, Anwar, and Abdul."

Complicit police authorities refuse to take action against the barbaric criminals because they enjoy an unholy patronage of a local political leader who takes his power and clout for granted.

They agitate against political patronage the criminals enjoy and demand their immediate arrest. The criminals murder Barun while he was returning from school. Binod Bihari Dutta, who met Barun before his death and was inspired by his idealistic, socially responsible thinking, is shocked to know of Barun's death and rushes to Dukhia to give justice to his memory. He learns of the menace and depravity, the criminals have subjected the village to and the fact that after Barun's death, the criminals were released by the corrupt police officers. Binod Dutta tries to motivate villagers like Barun had done before to continue their fight against this malaise. Special Branch Officer, badass no-nonsense cop Animesh Dutta's posting at Dukhia comes as sweet serendipity, almost divine intervention.

659,Raid (2018 film),"The film focuses on an lRS officer Amay Patnaik (Ajay Devgn), who has just been transferred to Lucknow as Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, where he lives happily with his wife Malini (Ileana D'Cruz). One day, he receives an anonymous tip about black money hoarded by (Member of Parliament) Rameshwar Singh (Saurabh Shukla), the don of Sitagarh, who had evaded income tax for a long time. So, Amay and his team, after much planning, head to Sitagarh. There he and his team face opposition from Rameshwar's very hostile family, but he holds up to his ideals and integrity. He searches every nook and cranny of the house with his team to find the black money without any success. After a few hours of searching, when all hope seems lost, he receives an anonymous letter, along with a map, revealing the location of the money in the house. Amay and his team break down the walls, ceilings, staircases and old storerooms (with the help of the map) to find assets worth crores (tens of millions). MP Rameshwar, not willing to accept defeat, goads Amay into letting him leave the house.
He then meets the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, who refuses any help as the Income Tax department is under the control of the Central Government and the raid is legal. The Central Finance Minister is persuaded to call Amay, but is promptly rebuffed. A relentless Rameshwar meets several MPs, politicians, senior officers and even the Prime Minister, but to no avail. He then rallies his political support and threatens to topple the state cabinet unless the Prime Minister agrees to meet him. As the raid continues for a 3rd consecutive night, the PM and Rameshwar meet. The PM calls Amay and asks him to look for other legal options; Amay agrees to comply, as long as she furnishes a signed order through fax ordering Amay and his team to stop the raid, effectively negating the request. The PM realizes that a written order pressurizing the IRS Officer to stop the raid may reach the media and the Government may be brought into disrepute. She refuses to help and sends Rameshwar away. Frustrated, Rameshwar upon exhausting his political options, tries the tack of attacking Amay's wife Malini, who narrowly escapes. On hearing this, Amay becomes furious but decides to control his anger.
Finally, on the 4th day, at noon, Rameshwar sends his henchmen to kill Amay and his team. A long battle ensues and a nearly defeated Amay is saved in the nick of time by a special police force sent in by the PM. Rameshwar is arrested and before being led away in handcuffs, he asks Amay about the identity of his informer. Amay refuses to divulge that information. It revealed that Rameshwar's youngest daughter-in-law was the informer; she and her lover wanted revenge on Rameshwar for forcing her to marry his impotent son as part of a political deal. Rameshwar is seen wondering about the informer's identity in prison while Amay gets transferred to another city, with hopes of a brighter future."
660,Rakta Charitra,"Narasimha Reddy, a local politician, is a powerful man in the area. His close associate Veera Bhadra (Rajendra Gupta), is his trustworthy ally for his political work, to the extent that Narasimha Reddy gives him the freedom to contest Jilla Parishad polls with his men. Veera Bhadra champions the causes of the poor and oppressed, and they look up to him like their leader.
Nagamuni Reddy (Kota Srinivasa Rao), who is the local MLA of the district and close to Narasimha Reddy, becomes jealous of the budding trust between Veera Bhadra and Narasimha Reddy, and starts poisoning Narasimha Reddy against Veera Bhadra. Narasimha summons Veera Bhadra and asks him not to contest the polls with his contestants, but rather support Nagamuni Reddy's. Veera Bhadra lashes out at Narasimha Reddy for being unfair to the underprivileged communities and storms out. Nagamuni Reddy calls for Manda (Ashish Vidyarthi), a close follower of Veerabhadra, and manipulates him into killing Veerabhadra, giving him the assurance that if he does it, people will suspect the policies of Veera Bhadra as his own follower killed him and he will be the next in line as the leader of the poor people, else take his life. Manda reluctantly agrees to it. Veerabhadra and his wife (Zarina Wahab) travel in a bus with 40 people to a wedding. Manda and Nagamani's men stop the bus, kill Veerabhadra's guards, and tell him to step out of the bus or else he will be killed along with the other innocents on the bus. Veera Bhadra comes out, looking at Manda, and dares him to kill. Nagamani's henchman Durga shoots at Veerabhadra, making it look like Manda shot at him; prompting Manda about the deal he made with Nagamani, he tells him to kill him in front of everyone. Manda takes a boulder and crushes Veerabhadra's skull, and kills him.
This results in an agitation led by Shankar, who wants to avenge his father's murder by killing all the men of Nagamani and Narasimha Reddy. Enter Nagamuni's son Bukka Reddy (Abhimanyu Singh), described as a ruthless man who enjoys raping women and killing men in brutal ways. He starts killing Shankar's men in gory ways: drilling a hole into their skull, chopping off their heads with a sugarcane chopper, burning them alive and feeding them to ravenous rats.
Pratap Ravi (Vivek Oberoi), who is in college in the city of Anantapur, gets the news of his father's murder and rushes to the village. Nagamani Reddy orders the local police inspector to kill Shankar in a fake encounter. When Pratap Ravi goes to the police station to ask about his brother, the inspector shows him Shankar's dead body and mocks him. Infuriated with his brother's murder, Pratap Ravi and Veerabhadra's men kill all the police officers and the inspector.
Pratap Ravi hides in the jungle with his father's associates and vows to kill Narsimha Reddy, Nagamuni Reddy and Manda one by one, instilling fear of death in each one of them. He starts by busting into the house of Narasimha Reddy, killing his guards and finally killing him with a scythe in front of his wife as she looks on in horror. Next is Manda; as he roams in the market, Pratap's men follow him, and before he can defend himself, they chop his hand off. Manda begs for his life, but Pratap stabs him in front of everyone. They plan to kill Nagamuni Reddy, but they are cautious as there is heavy police security in his house. As Nagamani Reddy is sitting on his lawn conversing with a police officer, he is shot at by Pratap, who is dressed as the cop, and his men, dressed as cops as well, kill most of the policemen.
The story progresses as famed film star-turned-politician Shivaji Rao targets Anantapur for contesting elections. The day he enters Anantapur for the rally, Bukka Reddy's men throw bombs, which makes Shivaji Rao get back inside the car and go back. This insults him greatly, and he asks his secretary for the one who can stop Bukka Reddy. Immediately, his secretary mentions Pratap Ravi's name; Shivaji Rao sends for him and puts down a proposal of joining his party and ticket for contesting elections. On the other hand, Bukka Reddy makes his brother Puru Reddy contest for elections and tries to sabotage the voting process by stealing the ballots. Pratap starts his rampage by eliminating, one by one, every rival of his party. Eventually, he comes across a man named Babu Qadri, who seeks Pratap's help in avenging his sister's death. Bukka Reddy had raped his 16-year-old sister, because of which she immolated herself, and Bukka had then broken Babu Qadri's leg. Pratap assures him his vengeance but asks him to forget everything for some time.
As Bukka Reddy's men fail in rigging the election process, Pratap Ravi wins by a majority. Immediately, Bukka Reddy is arrested. Puru Reddy gets him out on bail through Sirji's influence. Bukka, inflamed with the desire to avenge his father's death, hides out in an apartment with his men, and plots to kill Pratap Ravi. Pratap learns about his hideout devises a plan to execute him. He immediately gathers his men and calls Babu Qadri, who had sought Pratap's help in avenging his sister, to lead the execution of Bukka Reddy. He calls for the servant of Bukka Reddy and bribes him with 500,000 to aid in the execution. Babu Qadri and Pratap's men rush into the apartment, killing all Bukka's men; then killing Bukka Reddy with an axe."
661,Rakta Charitra 2,"The first half-hour is a recap of part I, such as the events of how Pratap Ravi (Vivek Oberoi) takes revenge for the murder of his father and brother, as well as how he comes to power. When no one in Andhra has the courage to stand up against Ravi, a man comes into the light to seek revenge on Prathap. Yeturi Suryanarayana Reddy, a.k.a. Surya (Suriya) is seen waiting in the woods near the main road, waiting for Pratap Ravi and hurls a bomb at his convoy. Unfortunately for Surya, Pratap Ravi escapes the bomb blast. Pratap Ravi's henchmen attempt to kill Surya, but he manages to escape.
Surya informs his wife that he missed the chance of killing Pratap Ravi. Meanwhile, the media asks Pratap Ravi if this attempt is a Surya's revenge for the TV bomb placed in Surya's home by Pratap himself. Pratap Ravi denies the charge. Shivaji Rao asks Pratap to stop this vengeance, but Prathap insists on killing Surya. Pratap orders his action team to kill anyone who opposes him. DCP Mohan Prasad (Sudeepa) starts to investigate the case. He finds Bhavani (Priyamani), wife of Surya, and demands Surya to surrender or else he would harm his wife and baby son Arya. Surya thinks that he has missed a great chance and another chance will not come so easily and decides to surrender for protection plots to kill Prathap Ravi. DCP Mohan Prasad produces Surya in court to face trial. Prathap Ravi sends a henchmen to kill Surya in the court itself, but Surya manages to fight him and kills the henchman in front of the judge. Surya is sent to prison.
Pratap Ravi decides to kill Surya inside the jail, he plans carefully and decides someone from outside their camp should do this, so that the police does not suspect them. In prison, Surya befriends Muddu Krishna by telling him his story. The flashback shows that after Pratap Ravi's attempt to kill Narasimha Reddy (Kitty), Surya's brother wants to take revenge. Surya, on the other hand, doesn't want to take revenge straight away, and tells him to be patient and to leave the matter as it is, as he doesn't want to put his mother and sister in any danger. Within a few months, Surya's entire family is killed in the TV bomb blast. After hearing the story, Muddu Krishna decides to help Surya in killing Ravi. The henchmen in prison try to kill Surya, but Surya fights them back. After this failure, Pratap Ravi is warned by Shivaji Rao. As a result, Pratap Ravi decides that he wants to stop this revenge, and he meets Surya in jail. Ravi tells Surya to stop this bloodshed, to which Surya promptly replies, ""I'll surely stop – after killing you"". Prathap thinks he can't do anything because he is in jail, which makes him defenceless.
Enter Krishnaswamy, the opposition Party leader, who decides to meet Surya. He says that to kill Pratap Ravi, Surya has to become a bigger name in Anantapur than Pratap Ravi. Krishnaswamy requests Surya to ask his wife to stand in the election. Surya convinces Bhavani to stand for election. This makes Ravi to fear for his life and also for his ministerial post, consequently his henchmen want to eliminate Bhavani but Nandini (Radhika Apte) pleads with Pratap Ravi not to kill Bhavani, causing Ravi to abort the plan. However, one of Ravi's closest gang members, Umapati, is already on his way to kill Bhavani. Muddu Krishna kills Umapati and saves Bhavani. Krishnaswamy comes to the prison to thank Surya, and Surya thanks him in return.
A scared Pratap organises a meeting involving the leaders of all the districts in Andhra Pradesh. Knowing this, Surya plots to kill Pratap Ravi. He realises that in the meeting, all the leaders will participate with their bodyguards. He orders Muddu Krishna to dress like a bodyguard since no one would be able to identify whose bodyguard belongs to whoever. Using this ambiguity, Surya's henchmen can kill Pratap Ravi. After the meeting comes to an end, Pratap Ravi plans to leave. As he was leaving, he sees a familiar face and is struck. He sees Surya, standing in front of him with his handgun. Surya fires at Pratap Ravi until he dies in a pool of blood. Surya's friends put tear gas and create panic, and under the cover of smoke, Surya escapes from the scene and returns to the prison. Nandini cries by hugging her dead husband, Pratap Ravi.
Muddu Krishna takes the blame for killing Pratap Ravi for Surya. DCP Mohan Prasad comes to meet Surya in jail and justifies why Pratap Ravi became a factionist. It was the circumstances that made Pratap Ravi a factionist. He adds to Surya that the same circumstances will change him into a Ravi. Surya finally says, ""Thank you, but I won't change into another Ravi"". The movie ends with the birth of Pratap Ravi's child."

665,Rustom (film),"Officer Rustom Pavri is happily married to Cynthia Pavri in 1959. Their marriage hits the rocks when he discovers that she is having an affair with his friend Vikram Makhija. After returning early from his ship's deployment, Rustom discovers Vikram's love letters in Cynthia's cupboard. While trying to find her, Rustom sees them together. He returns home and waits for Cynthia to return and then confronts her with the love letters, but walks away before Cynthia can explain. Rustom then gets himself a pistol from the naval ship's armory and makes a trunk call to Defence Secretary K. G. Bakshi at Defence HQ, New Delhi. Afterwards, he searches for Vikram, first in his office and then at his home. After Rustom enters Vikram's bedroom, the servant hears three gunshots and rushes to the room, to discover Vikram killed with three bullets on his chest and Rustom walking away with the pistol in his hand. Rustom immediately surrenders to the police and Senior Inspector Vincent Lobo starts the investigation.
Vikram's sister Preeti Makhija meets with the public prosecutor, Lakshman Khangani to get Rustom the toughest punishment possible. Rustom refuses anybody's help and decides to fight the case on his own and prefers police custody. Rustom's senior naval officer, Rear Admiral Prashant Kamath, sends two goons to his house to search for a set of documents, but they fail to find anything. Scared, Cynthia rushes to jail to inform Rustom, who finally meets and listens to Cynthia's story, about how she was lonely and upset when Rustom went away to London for many months. With the connivance of Preeti, Vikram took advantage of Cynthia's loneliness and she fell for him. However, on the day of Vikram's murder, Cynthia had already broken-up with him for the sake of her marriage.  She was slapped by Vikram after she broke up with him and got injured and walked out of Vikram's house.
On Rustom's instructions, Cynthia blackmails Kamath for Rs 50 million in exchange for the vital documents he needed. In the court hearing, Rustom unexpectedly pleads not guilty in front of the Judge Patel, which leads to a 9-member jury trial. At the culmination of the trial, Rustom is found not guilty by the jury since he shot Vikram in self-defence. Meanwhile, it is found that Lobo was in Delhi and he had met Bakshi to obtain the recording of the trunk call that Rustom had made. When back in Bombay, the trunk call is played, convincing almost everyone that Rustom is guilty, and the court proceedings end for the jury to decide on their opinion.
On the eve of judgement day, Rustom tells Lobo the truth — he was posted in London in 1958  for several months inspecting an aircraft carrier that the Navy wants to purchase, but on inspection, it was found by Rustom that the carrier's hull was corroded, and it would have to be repaired and modified before the carrier could be transferred to India. Vikram was lobbying for the aircraft carrier to be bought by India, and he, along with Kamath, attempted to bribe him in order to convince him to say that the carrier is seaworthy. When Rustom attempted to notify Bakshi in London, Bakshi also attempted to bribe him and get the carrier to India. Vikram attempted to persuade him and Rustom then slapped him in disgust. Believing him to have showed the power of his uniform, Vikram had dated Cynthia to show Rustom his power of money and take revenge on him, but never really liked her for real. Rustom, angry at Vikram's revenge, took a pistol from the naval ship's armory, then called Bakshi telling him he wasn't going to spare Vikram and that he had papers exposing the carrier's unworthiness for the Navy. Rustom then went to Vikram's house and fatally shot him. Bakshi then sent Kamath to get the documents which Rustom said he had and on Lobo asking for the recording of the trunk call, gave him half the recording to hide his corruption. Rustom puts it thus that he did not reveal anything about the aircraft carrier so that the Navy would not have to be tainted with a corrupt image. Rustom then reveals that he never actually had any documents relating to the proof that the carrier was damaged.
The next day, Rustom is declared not guilty by the judge and the jury. Rustom and Cynthia walk out of the court with their heads held up high. The film ends with the Rustom and Cynthia couple on vacation after getting all Bakshi's commission money that Rustom got from Bakshi (involved in the deal at high level) for cutting the tape half. Rustom learned the result of the purchase after reading in the local newspaper about the carrier arriving in India in a robust condition, just as he had wished."
666,Sachin: A Billion Dreams,"The film follow two main plots- The first shows Sachin's childhood to his career till 1999.

The film follows a scene-wise narration of different celebrities including fellow cricketers and actors. Most of the scenes in the film are depicted through video recordings of Sachin's personal life, interviews and cricket matches.
Before the film, clips are shown of birth of Sachin's daughter Sara. The film begins with Sachin tricking his friend to fall in a bore. Sachin narrates about his early childhood that he developed an interest in Cricket after India's 1983 triumph. He used to learn cricket from his coach R. Achrekar. Due to accommodations, he shifted to his aunt's house close to the park. Sachin rose to fame after he made a 664-run partnership with Vinod Kambli. He grew up practicing cricket daily until he was signed by Yorkshire.
There is a narration of Indo-Pak rivalry after which Sachin makes his international debut against Pakistan where he performed well. He was picked in the squad for the 1992 Cricket World Cup where India didn't have a great run. Later on, Sachin started rising up the charts.
The scene cuts back to Sachin and his wife Anjali walking in a park. Sachin tells about how he met her and later on they married. The film follows Sachin developing glory towards the start of 1996 World Cup. During its semifinal, India was eliminated despite Sachin's best performance.
Unfortunately Sachin's father died in 1999 before the start of 1999 World Cup. He played in depression though he performed well despite India not reaching the finals. He was praised for his courage and brilliance. Following that, the film shows in detail the darkest phase of Indian cricket. After that, BCCI devised a new team with new players.

As a result, India was eliminated early in the journey by Sri Lanka. The team removed the coach and appointed Gary Kirsten as their coach.
A depressed Sachin is encouraged by his brother Ajit, to win the World Cup once and for all. Seeming maybe his last chance, he began to prepare everything before the 2011 Cricket World Cup being held in his country and the final in his own city. He eventually became the all-time Test run scorer. The film cuts back to his present life. Sachin tells that whenever he is upset, he always hangs out with his childhood friends.

The nun is Martha, a 45-year-old withering woman who lives in a secluded convent in Calcutta. Even in the sanctuary of the Church, she is haunted by a specter that threatens her sanity. The Wiccan, Ipsita, is called upon by the unconventional Mother Superior to heal Martha's soul.
The task is difficult as Martha is reticent in talking about the events in her past. Using her skills as a healer and her training as a Jungian psychotherapist, Ipsita gradually opens the door to Martha's story of the one who haunts her.
An Anglo-Indian girl called Claudia grows up with the angst of not knowing her mother Maureen, alienated in her Indian surroundings by her blue eyes and blonde hair.
The story now goes back and forth as events from Claudia's life begin to intersect Martha's and Ipsita tries to sort out the tangled threads of the past and present. In her search for the lost Maureen, whom everyone says looked much like her, Claudia becomes obsessed with her mother's image. She begins to turn into her mother. Like her, she seeks out and falls in love with a foreigner, Pierre, a young Frenchman who is in Calcutta for a doctorate. But Pierre is never sure who is in love with him, Claudia or Maureen.
As she tries to heal Martha with centuries-old Egyptian rituals of the Wicca, Ipsita learns of Claudia's struggle to keep her sanity and Martha's attempts to save her soul — how she tried hard to bring her to the Church and let God heal her. Ipsita also learns that somewhere the attempts failed. Something happened. Claudia's burden became Martha's. With her own efforts failing to heal Martha's spirit, Ipsita is led to a startling discovery in the end which makes her wonder if the sacred will ever be as strong in us as the evil is."

One day, Maara is visited by Sundari alias Bommi, whose family is looking for a suitable groom for her. Maara is impressed by Bommi's nature and agrees to marry her. He tells her that he grew up as a rebellious boy, much to his father's dismay, and had a strained relationship with him. Later, he joined the Air Force where he excelled. He was often reprimanded by his superior, M. Naidu due to his rebellious nature. When his father was on his deathbed, Maara tried to book a flight home but found that he did not have enough money. He requests many people to help him out financially, to no avail. By the time he reached, his father had already died. This launched his ambition for starting a low-cost carrier.

He proposes they work together and start a low-cost carrier. Paresh, however, believes that the poor should not travel with the rich and humiliates Maara.

He names his airline Deccan Air and sells tickets at railway stations and petrol pumps hoping to get customers. Retired Air Force pilots are hired to fly the planes and Bommi is made in charge of the in-flight catering.

But all other flights get completely booked. With tears of happiness in his eyes, Maara watches the other flights touch down.

684,Sri Shirdi Saibaba Mahathyam,"Sadguru Sai Baba of Shirdi lived in British India. He was initially shunned by both Hindus and Muslims, especially by Hindu Bal Bhate. Sai was a Muslim and Bal Bhate forbade him to enter any Temple. Rohila, a Muslim, who thought Sai was desecrating the local Masjid by performing Hindu prayers and incantations, attempted to kill Sai. Then he saw both the Allah and Bhagwan in Sai and became a devotee. When Sai was ready to give up his body and resurrect himself after 3 days, just like Lord Jesus, a disbelieving Bal had wanted Sai's body to be cremated within 24 hours - only to find out that Sai had indeed risen, and also became his devotee.
Bhagoti, a leper, who was cured by Sai became his follower. Though Sai had no relations, he did call Tatya's mother his sister; Tatya his maternal nephew; a devotee named Laxmi as his daughter, and an elderly woman as his mother. Sai displayed his true form and opulence to another devotee, Nana Chandorkar. Sai lived in a rebuilt Masjid and urged his devotees to pray to God, as the Creator and to love and respect all living beings. He begged for alms daily so that he could collect sins and wash them away.
He always uttered ""Allah Bhala Kare"" and ""Bhagwan Bhala Kare"" to both Muslims and Hindus alike. He appeared in a multitude forms to his devotees (Lord Jesus, Guru Nanak Devji, Allah, Bhagwan Shri Ganesh) to cater to the various tastes of devotees. Sai was also fond of Nanavli, a mentally challenged devotee, who often challenged Sai. He was one of the few who really understood and accepted Sai as Vishnu's Avatar. Sai appeared simultaneously in a wealthy man's and Nana's dreams and called upon them to construct a Mandir of Bhagwan Shri Krishna. While the construction was under way, Sai prophesied the death of Tatya. Shortly thereafter while bequeathing the nine coins symbolizing nine virtues to Laxmi (which depict Sravan, Kirtan, Smaran, Padaseva, Archana, Namaskar, Dastan, Samveta and Atmanivrdan) Sai was ready to demonstrate to his devotees why they should not worry about Tatya's impending demise."
685,The Stoneman Murders,"The serial killer dubbed 'Stoneman' by the media has just claimed his fifth victim and the case is still of little interest to the Bombay police. But to suspended sub-inspector Sanjay Shelar (for custodial death of a gangster) this killer poses an opportunity for reinstation. With the secret aid of his patronizing superior AIG Satam, Sanjay takes up the arduous process of tracking the murderer without any legal assistance. He asks help from an aide constable and friend Kamble whose wife has apparently run away. The official investigator of the case, Inspector Kedar Phadke, clashes incessantly with Sanjay. They, separately, delve deeper into the case, patrolling the city on their own. Sanjay takes the help of his informer Ghanshu who tells him about Mohammed, a cab driver operating only at midnight, whom everyone on the streets is starting to suspect as being the stoneman. Ghanshu is eventually also murdered on the footpath by the Stoneman. The Stoneman is shown to be killing people sleeping on the streets (beggars, workers, sweepers etc.). Another night the Stoneman tries to kill a beggar sleeping on the roadside but is saved by Kedar and some patrolling policemen. Kedar sees Sanjay and now starts to suspect him as the murderer. Sanjay finds that his private investigation room has been visited by the Stoneman as he sees vermilion smeared everywhere in the room. He also learns that Mohammed has run away from the city.
Sanjay contemplates possible danger to his wife Manali and asks her to leave for her village. At the railway station he encounters the Stoneman again, trying to kill another roadside man. Before he can catch him, Kedar with his team arrives and shoots Sanjay in the thigh, thinking him to be the killer. Sanjay escapes and the incident brings him closer to his wife who nurses his wounds. A search is out in the city for Sanjay now, who goes into hiding. He researches and realizes the killer himself is a policeman, from Kusumi Tribe, performing tantric rituals to cure impotency that calls for human sacrifices. He asks his trusted cop Kamble to tell this to AIG Satam, giving his research documents as evidence. In the climax, it is shown that Mohammed was only an ex-convict deployed by Kedar as a decoy to roam the streets at the latter's orders, and Kamble turns out to be the killer Stoneman when Sanjay arranges to meet him. Kamble attacks Sanjay with a stone about to commit his ninth and last murder, but both are saved by the police (Kedar and team). In a trap laid by the police in the hospital, when Kamble sneaks in to kill Sanjay, he is nabbed and the matter is closed. Satam and Phadke decide to hush up the case. Kamble is shot and buried in the jungle by Sanjay at Satam's orders. He tells Sanjay that he cannot be taken back into the police force.
In the end, a tantric is shown in Kamble's village performing a ritual, asking a man to make nine human sacrifices and this time to kill people in Calcutta. The story ends showing killings in Bombay and Calcutta in 1983 and 1987."

688,Swades,"Mohan Bhargava is a non-resident Indian who works as a Project Manager on the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) program at NASA in the United States. Mohan came to U. S. for college studies and kept on living there after his parents in India died in a car accident. He keeps worrying about Kaveri Amma, a nanny at his home in Uttar Pradesh who looked after him during his childhood days. After his parents' death, Kaveri Amma went to live in an old age home in Delhi and eventually lost contact with Mohan. Mohan wishes to go to India and bring Kaveri Amma back with him to the U. S. Due to the recent success of Phase I of his project, he takes a few weeks off and travels to India. He goes to the old age home but learns that Kaveri Amma no longer lives there and went to a village named Charanpur a year ago. Mohan then decides to travel to Charanpur, in Uttar Pradesh.
Mohan decides to rent a recreational vehicle to reach the village fearing that he might not get the required facilities there. Upon reaching Charanpur, he meets Kaveri Amma and learns how his childhood friend Geeta (whom he called ""Gitli"" in his childhood) brought Kaveri Amma to stay with her after Mohan's parents died. Geeta runs a school in Charanpur and works hard to improve the living conditions of the villagers through education. However, the village is divided largely by caste and religious beliefs. Geeta does not like Mohan's arrival as she thinks that he will take Kaveri Amma back with him to the U. S., leaving her and her younger brother Nandan ""Chiku"" alone. Kaveri Amma tells Mohan that she needs to get Geeta married first and that it is her responsibility. Geeta believes in women empowerment and gender equality. This attracts Mohan towards Geeta and he too tries to help her by campaigning for education among backward communities and also girls. Mohan befriends villagers Nivaaran and Melaram, and they support him in his campaign. Mohan also wins the attention of Dadaji, a kind village chief.
Slowly love blossoms between Mohan and Geeta. Kaveri Amma asks Mohan to visit a nearby village named Kodi, and collect money from a man named Haridas who owes it to Geeta. The story gives a journey to Mohan very similar to what happened to Mahatma Gandhi after he came back from South Africa. Mohan visits Kodi and feels pity seeing Haridas' poor condition, which is such that he is unable to provide his family with meals every day. Haridas tells Mohan that since his caste profession of a weaver wasn't earning him any money, he shifted to tenant farming. But this change in profession led to his ostracization from the village and the villagers even denied him water for his crops. Mohan understands the pathetic situation and realises that many villages in India are still like Kodi. He returns to Charanpur with a heavy heart and decides to do something for the welfare of the village.
Mohan extends his leave by three more weeks. He learns that electricity inconsistency and frequent power cuts are a big problem in Charanpur. He decides to set up a small hydroelectric power generation facility from a nearby water source. Mohan purchases all the equipment needed from his own funds and oversees the building of the power generation unit. The unit works and the village gets sufficient, consistent power from it.
Dadaji's health deteriorates and he passes away. Mohan is repeatedly called by NASA officials as the GPM project he was working on is reaching important stages and he has to return to the U. S. soon. Kaveri Amma tells him that she prefers to stay in Charanpur as it will be difficult for her to adapt to a new country at her age. Geeta also tells him that she will not settle down in another country and she would prefer it if Mohan stay in India with her and Kaveri Amma. Mohan returns to the U. S. with a heavy heart to complete the project. However, in the U. S., he has flashbacks of his time in India and wishes to return. After the successful completion of his project, he leaves U. S. and returns to India with intentions of working at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center, from where he can also work with NASA.

690,Talvar (film),"Fourteen-year-old Shruti Tandon has been found dead at her home in Sameer Vihar in Noida by her parents, Ramesh and Nutan, during the night of 15–16 March 2008. The local police initially look for Khempal, the missing servant but his decomposed body is later found on the terrace of the building where the Tandons live. The police question Kanhaiya, Khempal's close friend and the Tandons' assistant who says that Khempal might have been involved in a sexual relationship with Shruti. They begin to suspect the Tandons, and declare the murders a clear case of honour killing.
On 25 March, the Noida police arrest Ramesh for the murders. The police chief organises a press conference, at which he says that Ramesh murdered Shruti and Khempal after he found them in a compromising position attributing this to honour killing. The victim blaming of Shruti leads to public outrage, and the case is given to Joint Director Ashwin Kumar of the Central Department of Investigation (CDI) and ACP Vedant. Kumar is contemptuous of the sloppy first responders, who botched the initial crime-scene investigation. He believes that the parents are innocent, and methodically builds a case against the father's resentful assistant. His team uses narco tests in their attempt to prove that the assistant (and two accomplices) committed the murders.
Kumar exonerates the parents on 22 June 2008, and Ramesh is released from jail. As Kumar is about to conclude his investigation, his senior officer retires and is replaced by a new CDI chief. ACP Vedant, eager to receive a promotion, begins working against Kumar. This leads to an altercation between the two officers, which results in Kumar's suspension. The CDI gives the case to a new investigative team led by Kumar's former superior, Paul, who concludes that the parents committed the murders. Both investigative teams, with opposing hypotheses, make their cases to the CDI chief. The CDI files a closure report in the Ghaziabad court naming the parents as prime suspects, but the evidence is insufficient to prosecute. The Tandons file a protest plea against the CDI report. The judge rejects the closure report, and accuses the parents in the case. The trial begins on 8 June 2012, and the Tandons are convicted of the murders several months later."
691,Tanhaji,"In 1647, Tanhaji's father, Kaloji Malusare trains him in sword-fighting, later succumbing to a Mughal plunder in Umrat. 17 years later in 1664, a now-adult Tanhaji (Ajay Devgn) with his younger brother Suryaji, commands Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's (Sharad Kelkar) Maratha Army to attack an intruding Mughal cavalry.
In 1665, the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb (Luke Kenny) dispatches one of his generals the king of Amber Jai Singh to capture Shivaji to stop his rapid imperial expansion in Deccan, thus he captured Shivaji alongside his 23 forts under his control(battle of purandar). Later, the Mughal general Beshak Khan orders a quick vacation of the strategic fortress Kondhana(now known as sinhagad fort), insulting Jijabai (Padmavati Rao), Shivaji's mother, who swears to remain barefoot until the Marathas recapture the fort. Tanhaji is informed about the treaty as well. Five years later, Shivaji Raje's spy informs him about Aurangzeb's plan to assign the Kondhana fort to his Rajput general Udaybhan Rathod (Saif Ali Khan) and to use it as a base for Aurangzeb's southern imperial expansion. Raje plans to recapture Kondhana, considering himself to lead the campaign as Tanhaji, though an able general, can't be employed due to his son Rayba's upcoming wedding. Meanwhile, Tanhaji celebrates Holi with his family. Marathas begin their war preparations and Shivaji warns his generals to keep Tanhaji from knowing about the campaign. Tanhaji arrives at Rajgad for inviting Shivaji to Rayba's wedding. Chandraji Pisal, a Maratha general, who's attempting to usurp Shivaji Raje's throne, discloses to Tanhaji the secret plan at his nephew Chultya's recommendation. Tanhaji convinces Shivaji and Jijabai to permit him to lead the campaign and postpones Rayba's wedding.
Elsewhere, Udaybhan reaches Burhanpur while the Marathas discuss his route possibilities. Tanhaji coins an attack plan but Pisal sends Chultya to warn Udaybhan about this plan. Pisal schemes of sabotaging Tanhaji's mission and getting him killed so that Shivaji Raje would then appoint him in-charge of the mission. Pisal intends to become influential enough to overthrow Shivaji Raje and join hands with Udaybhan. Udaybhan is also bringing an imprisoned Kamla Devi (Neha Sharma) en route, the sister of his Rajput general Jagat Singh (Vipul Gupta). Chultya informs Udaybhan about Tanhaji's attack plan and he tricks Tanhaji into attacking Maratha soldiers disguised under Mughal attire. Elsewhere, Udaybhan reaches Kondhana and aims a huge cannon called Nagin at Rajgad, threatening Shivaji's safety. Dejected, Tanhaji reaches Kondhana alone to learn about a secret thief-entrance inside. Udaybhan kills a guard for disobeying the security protocol. Tanhaji recovers his dead remains and motivates the villagers to betray Udaybhan. He is recommended to participate in a Shivratri event on Kondhana where he kills Chultya for betrayal. Tanhaji is imprisoned and tortured by Udaybhan. Jagat Singh secretly releases Tanhaji, revealing Udaybhan's plan to marry his sister. Tanhaji promises to release them from Udaybhan's clutches. Tanhaji escapes from the thief-entrance and returns to Umrat where he informs his people about the upcoming war. Savitri Bai (Kajol), Tanhaji's wife, worries about her husband's life and son's wedding. Tanhaji convinces Savitri Bai that everything will be alright, which she replies to by asking him what he wants from her when he returns. Tanhaji makes Savitri Bai promise to wear bridal attire while waiting for him.
Udaybhan hangs the guards responsible for Tanhaji's escape and Jagat Singh agrees to get his sister married to Udaybhan on Ashtami's eve, thus, convincing her to fake the marriage preparation until Tanhaji arrives. Tanhaji now plans to directly attack Kondhana during Ashtami night on 4 February 1670. He scales the fort through various entrances and attacks the Mughal army. The confusion allows Jagat and Kamla Devi to escape. Udaybhan is alerted and Tanhaji dies in the ensuing battle, although he captures Kondhana before killing Udaybhan. Shivaji's army conquers Kondhana but he ends up breaking into tears over Tanhaji's death; saying ""Gad aala pan sinh gela"" (The fort has been captured but we lost the lion). Later, He personally oversees Rayba's marriage while Savitri Bai fulfill's her promise to Tanhaji by adorning herself as a bride behind closed doors as she awaits his return, and Aurangzeb's dream of winning southern India remains unfilled for 18 years until he himself came and retook it from Marathas."

Now that the heart is available the only issue is to transport the heart from Mumbai to Pune. Due to weather problems and low visibility conditions, no choppers or aircraft are available to transport the heart. The only option remaining to transport it through road.
They approach Joint Commissioner of Traffic Gurbir Singh (Jimmy Sheirgill) who initially refuses to accept the mission due to the complexity and risk involved in it. However he heeds to the persuasion of Dr. Simon D'Souza and finally agrees to take responsibility of the mission
However due to the risk involved, no police officer comes ahead to take up the challenging task. However Godbole who wishes to regain the respect he lost due to the bribe incident comes forward volunteering to be the chauffeur of the Tata Safari Storme police van which will transport the heart to Pune. Accompanying him on this mission are Dr. Abel and Rajeev.
Everything goes smoothly for sometime. But at a point Dr. Abel and thus places a knife on Rajeev's neck, forcing Godbole to deviate from the highway into a forest road. However Rajeev retaliates leading to a fight. Abel phones his sister Maria (Kaveri Kalyani) and speaks that he had hit his wife Shwetha (Richa Panai) with a car as he was quite angry with the fact that she was cheating on him with his best friend Hemaan and she has possibly died, so he wishes to save himself from the clutches of the police. Dev Kapoor phones him and convinces him that he can save Abel, however Abel is shown not to be so convinced.
Here Maya (Divya Dutta), Dev Kapoor's wife explains her mental traumatic condition due to the heart problem of her daughter for the last 13 years. And explains that no other problem can be bigger than this one. Abel gets convinced and advises Godbole and Rajeev to leave. However Godbole decides to have Abel with them and in spite of the repeated suggestions from the Commissioner Gurbir to get him arrested, he has him in the mission.
They are then shown to enter a road and cross Lonavala Toll which is 8 km (5.0 mi) ahead of the route time table, thus making up for the time they lost in the forest. and Godbole has to drive now at a high speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) in order to make it to Fortis Pune. Godbole crosses places at high speeds till they come to a point where the road has been blocked by the police as a tanker has faced an accident. Back in Mumbai Gurbir's team discuss that if they were 4 km (2.5 mi) behind they could have taken the NH4 Diversion and reached. However they discuss that a communally very sensitive area Bilal Colony falls on this route and it might be difficult to get through here. Godbole listening to all this through the wireless decides to turn the vehicle and take the Bilal Colony route. Gurbir informs that it is impossible for the police to do anything here due to the strong minority and that the mission now depends on public and its support.
Dev Kapoor phones Aslam Khan (Raj Arjun) an influential person in Bilal Colony who goes out of his ways in order to ensure that there is no obstruction to the police van. Rajeev knows the place very well and thus exits the vehicle as soon as they enter the colony to ensure the roads are clear. In midway, Dr. Abel also exits the vehicle to remove two vehicles which are blocking the route.
Gurbir informs Godbole that there is a group of pilgrims going to Pandharpur will come on their road and Godbole has to ensure that he crosses the road before they reach. However Aslam talks to the secretary of the group and sends his men to stop them till the vehicle crosses them, After which Abel boards the car by Aslam's assistance, and Rajeev after a long run is able to board the car. Godbole drives at high speeds and ensures that they reach Fortis Hospital at time. Covering the challenging feat in about two hours.
It is shown that Shwetha did not die and has no complaints regarding the accident against Abel, thus freeing him. Rehan's parents invite Aditi home as a symbol of acceptance a Ria opens her eyes, bringing joy to her family, Gurbir feels a sense of satisfaction and phones Dr. Simon D'Souza to thank him. Godbole en route to his home finds a few people fighting on the road regarding a minor accident, where he signals them to stop the fight. Thus the movie ends on a happy note."

729,Arjun: The Warrior Prince,"The story is based on the early life of the Prince Arjuna, loosely taken from the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata. The storyline begins with Arjun as a nine-year-old boy, and follows him until he grows into the warrior that the world knows him as. It explores his life with his brothers in Hastinapur, his training and education, and his ultimate discovery of the warrior within himself.
The film begins with Uttar, the young prince of Viratnagar (Kingdom of king Virata), asking a maid (Brihannala) to tell him a story. The maid narrates him the story of Arjun.
She tells him that Arjun was a student of Drona, and that he learned the art of warfare from him. He was more skilled than all the students of Drona. None of his own brothers, nor his cousins - the hundred Kauravas - could equal him in the art. Duryodhana and the other Kauravas despised the Pandavas, for they feared that they might usurp Duryodhana's throne. 
When the king Dhritrashtra grew older, the rivalry between his sons, the Kauravas and the Pandavas intensified. Twice, Duryodhana attempted to kill all the Pandavas, but failed. To avoid further conflict, Dhritrashtra proclaimed Duryodhana as the crown prince of Hastinapur, and asked Yudhishthira to be the king of a distant unkempt territory of the empire.
In the meantime, Arjun won a swayamvar, and married the daughter of the King of Panchala, Draupadi. Duryodhana, who loathed the Pandavas, hatched a conspiracy with his uncle Shakuni and won all that belonged to the Pandavas in a betting game called chaupar. After losing everything, Yudhishthira betted his own brothers and Draupadi, and even himself. Draupadi was insulted in front of everyone, but Arjuna could not say anything because Yudhishthira was the king, and the king's words are the last words. The Pandavas, according to the rules of the game, had to go into exile for twelve years and an agyatavasa for one year.
While all the Pandavas go one way, Arjuna travels North to do tapasya. Before leaving, Draupadi makes him promise that he will take revenge for her insult. He then leaves, and does tapasya, during which he earns a bow from the Lord Shiva.
The story then shifts back to the present day Viratnagar. It is revealed that the Pandavas are spending their secret exile, or 'agyatavasa', there, and are noticed by some of the spies of Duryodhana. According to the outcome of the game, if any one of the Pandavas is found before the end of that one year, the Pandavas will have to again go for a twelve-year exile. 
The spy informs Duryodhana that the Pandavas are in Viratnagar. So he launches an attack on Viratnagar with the help of his bandit friends. The king of Viratnagar leaves to thrash the marauding bandits. However, that is the bait. From the other direction, Duryodhana's army comes, and it seems that the young prince of Viratnagar is the only one who is left to fight.
Uttar's maid drives the young prince's chariot to the field, but the prince, distraught by the number of enemies, flees. The maid stops him, and reveals her true identity: the maid (Brihannala) comes out as Arjun. Arjun retrieves his bow and makes prince Uttar drive his chariot. The warrior massacres the army and emerges victorious, and at last, Arjuna alone defeats all Kaurava warriors, including Bhisma and Drona."

735,Chhota Bheem,"The series is set in the fictional kingdom of Dholakpur, somewhere in rural India. The series revolves around Bheem, sometimes referred to as Chhota Bheem (little Bheem) due to his young age, a boy who is strong and intelligent. Bheem's rival is Kalia, who is envious of Bheem's popularity. Kalia, along with his sidekicks, twin brothers Dholu and Bholu, always plot to embarrass and defeat Bheem, but never succeeds.
Most of the initial stories revolved around Bheem and his friends Chutki, Raju and Jaggu's rivalry with Kalia and his friends Dholu and Bholu. However, as the series has progressed, this topic has been adopted as the subject less often, although Kalia is still just as eager to prove himself superior to Bheem. A large number of episodes, along with all the films, also focus on Bheem and his team solving various problems affecting the village, unravelling mysteries, fighting evils that seek to harm Dholakpur or its inhabitants, and on their antics, which often get them into trouble.
During Bheem's early days, the broadcaster Pogo had stressed that the storyline is kept simple and mysteries and complex plot avoided at all cost, as the viewers were too young to understand, but nowadays there is no such restriction. The timeline and Dholakpur too have been allowed to become fluid and stretchable and this has caused the characters to become more person-like and less childish. Supernatural events have often been used in episodes, like Dholakpur being attacked by the demon Zimbara, the evil witch, or Botakpur. Bheem and his team participating in various competitions in Dholakpur or in adjoining kingdoms are also a common theme, as is the celebration of Indian festivities."

However, as the series has progressed, this topic has been adopted as the subject less often, although Kalia is still just as eager to prove himself superior to Bheem. A large number of episodes, along with all the films, also focus on Bheem and his team solving various problems affecting the village, unravelling mysteries, fighting evils that seek to harm Dholakpur or its inhabitants, and on their antics, which often get them into trouble.
During Bheem's early days, the broadcaster Pogo had stressed that the storyline is kept simple and mysteries and complex plot avoided at all cost, as the viewers were too young to understand, but nowadays there is no such restriction. The timeline and Dholakpur too have been allowed to become fluid and stretchable and this has caused the characters to become more person-like and less childish. Supernatural events have often been used in episodes, like Dholakpur being attacked by the demon Zimbara, the evil witch, or Botakpur. Bheem and his team participating in various competitions in Dholakpur or in adjoining kingdoms are also a common theme, as is the celebration of Indian festivities."

The film carries a flashback of the morning with Yuvi and Sultan playing in the forest and Sultan teaching self-defence to Yuvi while his mother, Begum, enters.

Many believe that leaving their homes is the only way to survive; however, Bajrangi, a monkey, says that he would beat out the wits of those men with his so-called ""vanarsena"" - Marela and Bharela, but Bagga the bear advises him to talk to humans and Bajrangi asks whether there is anyone who knows the language of humans. A white bird, seemingly a pigeon, Hawa Hawaai pipes up, saying he knows someone who knows both animal and human languages. Yuvi meets the white bird the next day, and asks who is the one he said about. The white bird says the animal he spoke of is Alex, a parrot who lives with a director, Vikram Khosla. Bajrangi, his ""army"" of two monkeys, Hawa Hawaai, Bagga, and Yuvi go and kidnap the parrot and convince him to go to Delhi with them to talk to the parliament and save their land.

Begum arrives in time to save them.
After this incident, Alex pretends to have lost his voice. The animals consult a doctor who prescribes some ayurvedic medicines to recover Alex's voice, claiming that he has hypertension, stress, and high blood pressure. Bajrangi wholeheartedly does the hard work, sometimes getting injured. One day, he discovers that Alex was just pretending and chases him, inadvertently hitting a beehive. All the animals run with bees chasing them. A thrilling experience of trains follows after Bajrangi tells Alex how guilty he feels of thinking to kill him. Alex also realizes how selfish he was and decides to help he animals. Begum tells that no one is going to Delhi after listening to a tiger's story of how he only survived death at a human's hands by being a coward and forsaking his old ways; thankfully, following a pep talk and seeing Sultan's spirit and Yuvi who inspires them, Begum changes her mind and with renewed hope, proceeds to Delhi. They finally reach Delhi and tell their message through Alex to the Prime Minister of the country that they want peace between humans and animals and how Yuvi inspired all of them to go to Delhi despite all the incidents. In the last scene, it is shown the jungle is saved courtesy of a shared land act (with the area being called the ""Sanjay Gandhi National Park-Borivali"") and all are happy and settled.

He is originally not allowed to participate in the challenge because he is not royalty, but Duryodhan declares him the King of Ang, eager to see Karan defeat Arjuna. Seeing them duel each other, Dronacharya declares Karan and Arjuna as equally skillful warriors. Yudhishtir is declared the King of Hastinapur, which makes Duryodhan jealous. His uncle, Shakuni, helps him devise a plan that will burn the Pandavas to ashes. They plan to burn their palace, but Vidur, another uncle, tells Bheem of the plan beforehand. Everyone believes that the Pandavas and Kunti have been burned alive, but with the help of Vidur, they use an underground escape route to flee the burning palace.

Krishna reminds him that souls are immortal, so he should not worry about killing his family members' bodies. The Pandavas realize that they can't win until Bheeshma is on the battlefield because he has a boon that he cannot die. Arjuna reluctantly shoots him with many arrows to incapacitate him. The Pandavas send Arjuna's son Abhimanyu on the battlefield to break Dronacharya's labyrinth. Duryodhan and Shakuni trap Abhimanyu in the labyrinth formation and stab him from the back.

She prays to Krishna, who ensures her cloth does not run out and protects her honour.
The Pandavas go into exile in the forest for thirteen years. After their twelfth year in the forest, Yaksha appears to Sahadev and says he must answers questions before drinking water from the lake. Sahadev does not comply, so when he drinks the water, he falls dead. The other brothers also fail to answer the questions before drinking. Dharma answers satisfactorily, and Yaksha resurrects all of his brothers.
After the thirteen years of exile are over, Dhuri refuses to give the Pandavas back their kingdom. In consulting Krishna, Dhuri asks for a large army and Arjun asks for Krishna to be his charioteer. Arjuna expresses his hesitation in fighting against his family, but Krishna explains to him about his duty and the nature of life and death. When Arjuna's son Abhi enters the battlefield, Dhuri unfairly kills him. Krishna devises a plan to help defeat Dronacharya. Karna uses his most powerful weapon on Bhim's son, Ghatot, which means he cannot use it on Arjuna.
In a fit of rage, Dhuri violates the code of conduct and sets the Pandava's tents on fire, but Krishna protects them with rain. Dhuri jumps into a river to avoid being killed. Krishna tricks him into thinking it is beyond sunset, after which he comes out and fights with Bhima. Bhima kills him and the Pandavas rule Hastinapur righteously and justly."
751,Ramayana: The Epic,"The plot begins with Dashratha and his 3 wives ruling the kingdom Kosala, with the capital Ayodhya. The king and queens perform a special ritual to pray for children. Soon, Dasratha has 4 sons: Rama from Kaushalya, Bharata from Kaikeyi, and Lakshman and Shatrughna from Sumitra. Rama becomes known as a virtuous warrior and Vishamitra asks Dashratha to send Rama to help him defeat the demoness Tadka. After this incident, Vishwamitra takes Rama and Lakshmana to King Janak's swayamvara for his daughter Sita. Rama wins the contest by lifting and breaking Shiva's bow, where he and Sita get married. The 3 brothers also get married to Sita's other sister. Dashratha decides to make Rama as his successor. Kaikeyi agrees that as the eldest son, Rama deserves the throne. 
However, Manthara tells Kaikeyi that if Rama is crowned king, the other queens will become more powerful and that they will harass Kaikeyi and Bharat. Manthara reminds Kaikeyi that she has two boons to ask of Dashratha, where she asks Dashratha to crown Bharata as king and send Ram into exile for 14 years. Dashratha is pained to see him leaving, but Rama is determined not to disobey his father's orders. Lakshmana and Sita decide to join Rama in exile. Dashratha dies longing for Rama and Bharata refuses to be a part of his mother's conspiracy. Bharata follows Rama and asks him to come back, but Rama refuses, so Bharata takes his sandals back as a symbol of Rama's rule over Ayodhya. In exile, Agastya gifts the brothers divine weapons that make them invincible. 
In the 13 year of exile, Ravana's sister Shurpanakha meets Rama in the forest and is attracted to him. When he politely declines her offer to come with her, she threatens to kill Sita. To protect them, Lakshman cuts off her nose. When Ravana hears of his sister's humiliation, he plans vengeance by harming Sita. In the forest, Sita sees a beautiful deer and asks Rama to capture it for her. Rama goes to find the deer and instructs Lakshman to protect Sita while he's gone. When Rama strikes the deer, he finds that it is actually a demon named Marich in disguise, and he calls out for Sita and Lakshman in Rama's voice. Sita urges Lakshmana to make sure Rama is fine, where Lakshman draws a divine line of security around her to protect her while she is alone, telling her that she should not cross the line under any circumstances.
Ravana approaches Sita in disguise as an old sage seeking alms. He tricks her into exiting Lakshmana's circle of protection. Once she steps outside the boundary, he kidnaps her and takes her into the sky to Lanka. Jatayu tries to save Sita, but Ravana nearly kills him. To leave a trace of her path, Sita drops her jewelry from the sky, hoping someone will find it and trace their way back to her. Rama and Lakshmana come back to the hermitage and grieve over the missing Sita. Looking for her in the forest, the encounter the nearly dead Jatayu, who tells them she has been abducted. In their quest to find Sita, the brothers meet Shabri, who serves them devotedly. Ram and Lakshman reach Kishkindha, the kingdom of monkeys, where they meet Hanuman. 
Hanuman tells them that King Sugreev can help them if they help him win over his evil brother, Bali. Rama helps King Sugreeva win his kingdom back, where he enlists his entire monkey army to help him find Sita. Rama gives Hanuman his ring to show to Sita if he finds her, so she can trust him. He tells Hanuman and Angada's team to look for her in the southern part of India. Hanuman meets Jatayu's younger brother, who describes that he saw Ravana abducting a young woman and heading towards the island of Lanka. The monkeys are unsure how to cross the ocean, and Hanuman uses his powers to become extremely large and cross the ocean despite encountering obstacles along the way. When he arrives at Lanka, he makes himself tiny so he can sneak in. 
Once he finds the palace, Hanuman enters the garden and sees Sita from atop a tree. He overhears Ravana threatening Sita that she must accept him in two months. Hanuman shows Sita Ram's ring and asks her to come back with him. Sita refuses and says that to protect her honor, Rama must come save her and defeat Ravana himself. Hanuman wreaks havoc in Lanka. Ravana captures him and Hanuman warns him of war if he does not release Sita. To punish him, Ravana orders that Hanuman's tail be lit on fire. With the fire on his tail, Hanuman burns down the city. Ravana's brother Vibhishan tries to reason with him, so Ravana kicks him out of the kingdom. The war begins and the monkey army destroys much of Ravana's army. Ravana's wife asks him to reconsider and let Sita go, but he is further determined to win this war. 
Ravana sends his giant brother Kumbhakaran to the battlefield. Lakshmana is badly wounded and Hanuman brings the entire mountain that contains the divine herb Sanjeevani to revive him. Ravana sends his son who uses illusory powers to show Rama Sita's severed head. Ravana also shows Sita an illusion of Rama's severed head.  The monkey army interrupts Meghnad's ritual before he is granted invincibility. Finally, Ravana himself enters the battlefield. After a battle, Rama kills Ravana by shooting an arrow into his navel, his weak spot. Ram and Sita are united and the trio return to Ayodhya after 14 years. They are welcomed by all of the mothers and Rama is throned the king."
752,Return of Hanuman,"Devas are ’busy’ in their Swarglok (heaven). Technology has crossed the boundaries of earth and even non-mortal devas have become techno-geeks. They converse in Hinglish. Meanwhile, a terrific war is being fought between the Devas and the Asuras. In this war, Lord Vishnu slices the demon Rahuketu into two parts through his stomach. His collapse invokes the Guru of Asuras, Guru Shukracharya and he comes forward to battle with Lord Vishnu. He also slices a large snake named Kaladansh into two parts. Lord Vishnu gains an upper hand in the war and throws Shukracharya into space. Shukracharya announces a prophecy throughout the Universe warning Lord Vishnu that the same humans whom he is protecting, in Kali Yuga they will themselves become very cruel than even demons and a day will come when their cruelty will give rise to the greatest demon of the Universe which will engulf the whole humankind. Shukracharya then transforms himself into Planet Shukra or Venus and it becomes the home of demons. Later he joins Rahuketu's sliced body with that of Kaladansh's tail and vice versa. This gives rise to two demons Rahu and Ketu. Shukracharya declares that as long as his Sarpdand i.e. Snake Wand lives, the demons will remain powerful.
Hanuman, who has just returned to heaven after completing his task on earth, is bored. He sees a village boy who is bullied by his classmates. He decides to help him, not as a God or an invisible force but as a human. He then asks Lord Brahma to allow him to take birth as a human being. Brahma allows but keeps some conditions which Hanuman agrees to accept. He appears on earth in a village named Bajrangpur from a priest and his wife as a human baby. What makes the reincarnated Hanuman different from other humans is that he has a tail and a huge appetite. The baby is named ""Maruti"" by his mother. After Maruti is three months old, he takes admission in the same school where the boy he wanted to help studies and befriends with him. Thereafter, he teaches a lesson to his bully classmates, Gabbar Singh and his gang.
Meanwhile, on planet Shukra, there is a fight between Rahu and Ketu and accidentally the Sarpdand comes to Earth. Danavs come to Earth to search for it but they have to face Maruti. Maruti easily defeats Rahu and Ketu with the help of his army of monkeys that came to help him to get free from the hands of culprits (who caught him because he stole the mangoes from his garden). In order to defeat Rahu and Ketu, Narada must remind Maruti that he is actually Hanuman. After Narada and Maruti meet, Maruti is reminded that he can turn to Hanuman as per his will. Maruti then turns to the more powerful Hanuman, with his godly powers. He still has the appearance of a child but looks like child Hanuman, the appearance from the film's predecessor. Then a monster made of polythene and other non-biodegradable waste appears from a volcano that was said to form when Sarpdand merged with the Kamandal thrown by Shukracharya which coincidentally fell into the volcano in Bajrangpur. The monsters keep on swallowing the villagers of Bajrangpur. After struggling to stop the monster, Hanuman asked for help from God Ram. God Ram then said that when a blockage, which is seen in the end, is cleared then the monster (mainly made of plastic and other waste thrown by humans) will finish up. Hanuman did what Ram said, and the monster was defeated. Finally, Hanuman said his farewells to his family and friends and leaves Bajrangpur."
753,Roadside Romeo,"Romeo is a dog who once lived in luxurious surroundings. One day his owners decide to migrate to London and he is left at the mercy of the servant of the house, who dumps him on the streets of Mumbai. Left to fend for himself, he is soon cornered by the local gang – Guru, Interval, Hero English and a dog-wannabe-cat, Mini, who tell him that this is their domain. Romeo does not know the street lingo and is at a loss for words at first, but he manages to win the gang over with giving them haircuts. They love their new looks and accept Romeo as part of their gang. Together, they set up a successful dog-grooming business until Chhainu, the right-hand of gangster-dog Charlie Anna, arrives to collect ""weeklies"" (weekly protection money) in the form of bones. Romeo throws Chhainu out, and the others, terrified, go to Charlie to plead their case. Charlie threatens them with his trio of female ninja dogs, whom he calls his Angels, but Romeo tricks Charlie into allowing his friends to leave unhurt.
Romeo then meets Laila, who is singing from a rooftop, they dance and he falls in love. To win her over, Laila tells Romeo he must dance with her in front of everyone at the ""Moonlight Club"" where she performs. Romeo says yes, unaware that Charlie has long wanted her, and anyone who dares go near her is punished. However, Romeo braves the odds and dances with Laila to win her heart. As Laila starts falling in love with him, Charlie, in a fit of rage, captures and terrorizes Romeo. Romeo then promises that he would make Laila fall in love with Charlie. Romeo does not intend to lose Laila but plans to deflate Charlie's ego by having a disguised Mini pretend to be Laila and make it clear she's not interested. This only ends up exacerbating Charlie's ire, and Romeo promises him a second meeting with Leila.
The night of the appointment, however, Chhainu catches Romeo kissing Laila, who then shouts at Romeo telling Laila of Romeo's deal with Charlie and she angrily and violently slaps him and after she sees what Romeo had done says she never wants to see him again despite Romeo's pleas for forgiveness. In a pursuit, Charlie's Angels are wooed by Guru, Interval and Hero English, Chhainu is cornered by a mouse (and smashed with a ""jumbo jet"") and Charlie is chased and caught by the city dogcatchers. But just before Charlie is caught with a net, Romeo pushes him under the dog-catchers van to escape while Romeo goes, Charlie then convinces Guru, Hero English, Interval and Mini to create a distraction to get the guard away from the van, they all succeed and Charlie jumps on the van and says he will free Romeo using a pin in his chain to pick the lock, but the van begins to drive and he falls off, after which Charlie races after the van, losing the pin in the progress, but thankfully one of Charlie's ear hairs suffice.
They escape but Romeo feels there is no point staying as Laila said she never wanted to see him again, and Charlie badly wants her. The next morning, Romeo throws his sack onto an open train boxcar about to leave the station but Charlie arrives with Laila and the others. Charlie tells Romeo that he is a fool for leaving Laila when she still loves him, that he explained everything to her and says she is Romeo's and no one else's. He lets go of her hand and Laila begins to run after the train, while Romeo holds his hand out for her. Resembling a famous scene from Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Charlie remarks ""Where have I seen this before?"". She reaches for his hand and grabs it but the handle Romeo was holding had lost its top screws, making him fall off with Laila, after which they raise their heads to each other and say ""I love you"" in sync. It then goes to the ""Moonlight Club"" where everyone is back singing a reprise of ""Main Hoon Romeo"" in party-remix."

759,Ab Tak Chhappan,"The section of the Mumbai Police Department responsible for handling the underworld, known as the Crime Branch, is headed by Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar). Sadhu is the city's best inspector with an enviable reputation and a record of an encounter with shootings. Though challenging, he is a loving husband to his wife (Revathi) and father and also helps his informers and other poor people in times of need. His immediate junior, Imtiyaz Siddiqui (Yashpal Sharma), despises Sadhu to no end; he feels Sadhu intentionally belittles him. Also, Imtiyaz is more concerned about adding to his encounter score and therefore ends up killing more than the primary target, which is the main reason Sadhu dislikes him. To add to his woes, Imtiyaz is unable to surpass Sadhu's encounter ""score"". Enter Jatin (Nakul Vaid), a rookie in this line of policing who manages to impress Sadhu. The inspector takes the newcomer under his wing, further antagonizing Imtiyaz.  All of them report to Commissioner Pradhan (Mohan Agashe), who is a fair and honest police officer.
During these events, Sadhu establishes a love-hate friendship on the phone with Zameer (Prasad Purandare), a notorious underworld don based abroad, who grudgingly admires Sadhu for his no-nonsense attitude. Zameer and rival don, Rajashekhar, run the Mumbai underworld.
Sadhu Agashe's world begins to turn upside down as Pradhan retires and with the entrance of the new commissioner, M P Suchak (Jeeva) who has a strong link with the don, Rajashekhar. Suchak takes a liking towards Imtiyaz, who is willing to do encounters primarily with Zameer's men, mainly on Rajashekhar's orders. Suchak starts undermining and belittling Sadhu. Sadhu continues on his righteous path. Eventually, the pressures of his career take a toll on his personal life as some men kill his wife at the Jatin and Vaishali's wedding reception party. During his investigation into this matter, Sadhu kills Feroz, the right-hand man of Rajashekhar. Sadhu is compelled to resign from the force, and Suchak (on Rajashekhar's orders) sends Imtiyaz to kill Sadhu. Imtiaz gets killed in a peculiar chain of events, and Sadhu Agashe, a once famed inspector, becomes a fugitive of the law. Suchak announces shoot-at-sight orders against Sadhu despite Pradhan's advice to the contrary, and Sadhu is forced to ask Zameer for help in escaping from India.
Meanwhile, Jatin, who has been growing increasingly disenchanted by Suchak's behavior, resigns and calls for a press conference and exposes Suchak's connection with Rajashekhar. Suchak disputes this in his press conference but is suspended pending the investigation.
Sadhu goes to Zameer's HQ and thanks him for releasing him and tells him that he is now Zameer's man. As Zameer and Sadhu are drinking alone, Sadhu breaks a glass. Sadhu accuses Zameer of killing his wife. When Zameer tells Sadhu that it is Feroz who killed his wife, Sadhu informs him that he had killed Feroz earlier, and hence he was convinced that using Feroz's name, Zameer had murdered Sadhu's wife. Suddenly, Sadhu uses the broken glass to kill Zameer and escapes. Then the scene rolls forward to a location abroad where Sadhu and Pradhan are having coffee. When Pradhan asks Sadhu about why he had run away, thereby proving the allegations against him, Sadhu tells him that it is part of his plan. He was able to kill Zameer as a fugitive which he could never have done as a cop. He says that he will now go to Rajashekhar since Rajashekhar is thrilled at Zameer's death and kill him too. Sadhu says that he doesn't care what the world thinks of him, and he will always be a cop and will continue his work of eliminating crime until he dies. He requests Pradhan to look after his son, who is with his maternal aunt in Pune, and Pradhan contemplatively agrees. The end credits roll as Sadhu gets up and walks off after saying goodbye to Pradhan."

Months later, Adithya visits Meera's house, where her father Devdas Shetty sees them kissing and throws Adithya out.
Devdas opposes her and Adithya's relationship due to Adithya's brash behaviour and also because they belong to different castes. Adithya demands that Meera must make a decision within six hours otherwise he will end their relationship. Following this incident, Meera's parents seize her phone, making her unable to contact Adithya. By the time she manages to visit Adhi's house, he is drunk, injects morphine into himself, and becomes unconscious for two days. Meera is then forcibly married to someone from her caste. Adhi learns about the marriage from Parthi and goes to her house in protest. He is assaulted and gets arrested for making a scene. Adhi's father Vasudevan Varma ostracises him from the family home for damaging his reputation.
With Parthi's help, Adhi finds a rented apartment and joins a private hospital as a surgeon. To cope with his emotions, he starts taking drugs, attempts one-night stands, buys a pet dog and names it after Meera and drinks alcohol; all of which are unsuccessful. Within months, he becomes a successful surgeon and a high-functioning alcoholic who is feared by the hospital's staff members, one of the reasons being his high surgery count. Adhi's self-destructing behaviour and refusal to move on worries Parthi and Tarun. He persuades one of his patients, Priya Menen, a leading film star, to have a no-strings relationship with him, which he ends when she falls in love with him.
On a day off, Adhi unwillingly agrees to perform life-saving surgery and collapses with dehydration. The hospital staff examine his blood samples, which show traces of alcohol and cocaine. The hospital chief files a case against Adhitya, who accepts the truth on the grounds of violating his professional ethics during an in-house court hearing, despite Parthi making arrangements to bail him out. Adhi's medical license is cancelled for five years and he is evicted from the flat. The next morning, Parthi manages to reach Adithya to convey his grandmother's death; he meets Vasudevan, and they reconcile. Adhi gives up his self-destructive habits soon after.
While leaving for a vacation, Adhi sees a pregnant Meera sitting in a park. Convinced that she is unhappy with her marriage, Adhi meets her after returning from his vacation. Meera reveals that she left her husband days after their marriage and continued to work in a clinic. She tells Adhi that he is the child's father, and they reunite. The pair marries, and Meera's father apologises for misunderstanding their love for each other."
761,Aditya 369,"In 1991, Prof. Ramdas is a scientist who does vigorous experiments to invent the time machine at his home laboratory. Even after tremendous efforts, the machine does not seem to work. Meanwhile, Raja Verma, a high-profile thief has a peculiar hobby of burglary of antique pieces from the world's museums. His henchmen steal a 16th-century diamond, belonging to the period of the Vijayanagara empire from the Salar Jung Museum. The robbery is witnessed by Kishore, a school kid who is trapped in the museum on his school excursion. He manages to escape from the robbers and gets rescued by Krishna Kumar. However, no one believes Kishore, and the diamond is replaced by its duplicate in the museum.
Kishore gets to know that Prof. Ramdas is working on the time machine through his daughter Hema. One night, he along with other kids set it off in an attempt to go the day of the robbery. Hema and her fiancé Krishna Kumar rescue them but get accidentally trapped in the machine. The time machine takes off and visits the past, to the reign of the emperor Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara empire in the year 1526.
There, Krishna Kumar saves Simhanandini, a dancer in the royal court of Krishnadevaraya from an attempted raid, and she introduces them to the Emperor. Krishna Kumar surprises Krishnadevaraya by reciting the poem of his court's poet Tenali Ramakrishna before it's even written and explains to him that they have come from the future. Though Krishnadevaraya finds it hard to believe, he nevertheless offers them hospitality. A police constable who also happens to be trapped in the machine joins them. Later one night, they catch sight of the stolen diamond which is then in the possession of Krishnadevaraya. The emperor tells that when moonlight on the night of Karthika Punnami falls on the diamond, it radiates seven colors of the rainbow. Fascinated by it, they stay back to witness the event. It is also prophesied that the diamond would be stolen twice, once in the emperor's reign and again after 500 years.
Later, Simhanandini who lusts on Krishna Kumar accuses him of cheating her. However, Krishna Kumar is deemed innocent after a trial. To seek revenge, Simhanandini conspires with Senadhipathi to frame Krishna Kumar in the diamond robbery. Upon witnessing the diamond in Krishna Kumar's hand in a tussle with Senadhipathi, Krishnadevaraya sentences him to death. Though on the day of the execution, Krishnadevaraya believes Krishna Kumar's innocence saves him. This is later confirmed to him by Ramakrishna who witnesses the diamond being robbed by Senadhipathi. Krishna Kumar, Hema, and the constable escape and board the time machine which sets off again.
The machine takes them to the year 2504, a dystopian world destroyed by radiation after the end of the Third World War. Scientists of that era who already know about their arrival, receive them. In this era, the entire city is built underground and is powered by Krishnadevaraya's diamond. During their stay, they also watch the news from the year 1991. It reports that the diamond is retrieved from Raja Verma with the efforts of Krishna Kumar but he is killed in the process. The malfunctioning time machine is now repaired and when the environment begins to negatively affect them, they leave. The time machine brings them back to the present.
Raja Verma, who kidnaps Prof. Ramdas and Kishore to get hold of the time machine locates it abandoned on a hilltop. Krishna Kumar rescues them and combats with Raja Verma in the time machine. It is destroyed in the feud and both are reported dead. But Krishna Kumar who jumps off the cliff moments before it explodes is saved and joins his family."
762,Agraharathil Kazhutai,"In Madras, a female donkey is killed by a group of people. Her orphaned foal walks into the house of Narayanaswami, a Brahmin college professor. Narayanaswami, sympathetic after learning what happened, decides to raise the foal and names it 'Chinna'. Due to adopting a donkey, Narayanaswami faces ridicule in his neighbourhood and college. The principal feels this is affecting the college's reputation, and asks Narayanaswami to do something. Narayanaswami resigns and leaves with Chinna to his Agraharam (Brahmin village).
After Narayanaswami's arrival at the village, his parents are surprised at his idea to care for a foal. However, Narayanaswami convinces his father, and a deaf-mute girl Uma working as their maid is assigned to take care of Chinna. Narayanaswami returns to Madras for work. The village's other residents start criticising the idea of raising a foal in the Brahmin village. A gang of mischievous boys in the village take to harmful pranks, framing Chinna of having acted on its own.
When Narayanaswami returns some months later, his father mentions the incidents involving Chinna and how the neighbours are constantly complaining. Narayanaswami's brother Venkat shifts to the village and comes with his wife, who becomes upset by the foal's presence in the house. To keep the peace, Narayanaswami takes Chinna away, pays Uma to take care of it, and returns to Madras.
While taking Chinna to the fields, Uma encounters a worker. This develops into a physical relationship, and Uma soon becomes pregnant. The worker disappears, abandoning Uma. Chinna has now matured. Narayanaswami returns to the village after some months, and sees a pregnant Uma. She informs him that the temple priest was injured due because of Chinna; as a result, the villagers, headed by Srinivasa Iyer, sent it to a washerman. Narayanaswami goes to see Chinna, then leaves for Madras.
Uma's baby is stillborn; her mother leaves it at the mountain temple to conceal Uma's identity as the baby's unmarried mother. The temple priest finds the corpse and calls the other villagers, claiming this has diluted the temple's sanctity. Iyer suspects the baby is Uma's, and questions her mother about this. Uma's mother, frightened, confirms the suspicions, but lies that Chinna brought it to the temple. Iyer and the villagers become infuriated with the donkey, and it is stoned and beaten to death.
The village astrologer announces that, because of the sin of killing the donkey, the village will be haunted by omens. Instead, however, miracles beginning happening in the village. Iyer's long lost son returns; a paralysed woman starts walking; Venkat's wife becomes pregnant after being unable to conceive for years. On returning, Narayanaswami learns about these happenings. People superstitiously believe that the deceased donkey is responsible for all the miracles and Iyer suggests constructing a temple for the donkey, to which everyone agrees.
Narayanaswami finds Uma. Both search for Chinna's skeleton and find its skull. By then, the villagers arrive, pick up the skull and give a ritual funeral to Chinna by burning the skull, but the fire spreads and engulfs the whole village. Narayanaswami and Uma are the only survivors."
763,Amma Ariyan,"Preparing to leave for Delhi, Purushan bids his mother goodbye, promising to write to her regularly. In the thinly populated forest area of Wayanad in northeast Kerala, the jeep in which he is traveling is stopped by the Police, who take possession of it to carry a dead body found hanging on the wayside tree. The dead man's face looks familiar to Purushan. He becomes restless and is seized with a pathological obsession to find out the identity of the deceased. Against the wishes of his girlfriend, he abandons his trip to Delhi and sets out to seek his friends who may have some clue. Purushan meets journalist friends, doctors, and finally a veteran comrade, fondly addressed as Balettan who identifies the dead as the fellow musician who accompanied Satyajit, the guitarist. Satyajit confirms the deceased is his friend Hari, the tabla player. Together they decide to inform Hari's mother who stays in Cochin. They set out on a long eventful journey from the northern highlands of Wayanad to the Southern port city of Cochin.
As they move from Kozhikode to Beypore, Kodungalloor, Thrissur, Kottapuram, Vypin, and finally to Fort Kochi, the group swells as they meet many mothers and their sons and relatives who have known Hari; some had known him as a tabla player, some as Tony, the jazz drummer, and others as a silent political activist, a victim of police brutality, and a loner. And for others, he was a drug addict and one who used to drown his sorrow and pain in his music. Through their recollections, Hari's rather diffused identity unfolds. His classmates remember Hari as an introvert, weak and indecisive. His worker comrades identify him as a staunch revolutionary with strong resistance and willpower. But then what went wrong?
The colonial past of the places, what they took from us and what they left behind as well as the people's protests and uprisings, the region witnesses, and their heroes and victims are integrated into the narrative, by way of information as well as critique.
While reporting to his mother about Hari and his friends and their mothers on his southbound journey, John also reconstructs the history of the land through a series of class struggles, student protests, and workers union clashes that took place in the region where Purushan traversed. Starting with the medical students agitation against commercialization of medical  education, to a short dialogue with  Karuppuswamy, the unfortunate victim who had lost both his legs in a colliery workers struggle for better wages and human dignity, in Kottapuram, to Vypin island where several mazdoors (labourers) either died or lost their eyesight in the man-made hooch tragedy, to the Citizens group's forcible taking over of rice and sugar hoarded by unscrupulous black marketer traders and distributing to ordinary people at fair prices and giving back the money collected to the traders, to the manipulated fight between workers of two feuding unions in a Mattancherry street in Fort Kochi, where four fishermen had died, and also some targeted working-class leaders in a fake Police encounter, an abortive factory workers strike extending solidarity to the retrenched women workers in Fort Kochi, are some of the long list of peoples  protests and struggles reported with deep concern and feeling by Purushan in a long letter to his Mother.
As Purushan and his group wait for Hari's mother to come out of the Baptism ceremony from the church, they analyze their own past, noting the emerging debate focusing on the romantic evasions and tragic failures of the extremist movement. When Hari s mother finally turns up and faces the youth congregation, she asks ""Suicide wasn't it?""  The film ends with Purushan's mother watching Hari's mother wiping her tear."
764,Anbe Sivam,"Two men waiting for a flight to Chennai at the Biju Patnaik Airport in Bhubaneswar engage in conversation. One is a commercial director, Anbarasu, who prefers the abbreviated name A. Aras, and the other is a scarred and deformed socialist, Nallasivam (Nalla). When the flight is cancelled due to heavy rain, Aras initially suspects Nalla is a terrorist and informs the authorities, only to discover that he was mistaken. With the rain flooding the city, the two men are forced to share a room for the night. Both need to return to Chennai: Aras to be present at his wedding, and Nalla has to deliver a ₹3,200,000 cheque, recently awarded to him after he won a court case, to a group of union workers.
After a traumatic night, and no hope for a flight, the two men take a bus to board the Coromandel Express train. Aras's bag gets stolen on the way leaving him with only his credit card, which no one accepts. Using his presence of mind, Nalla repeatedly bails Aras out of trouble while Aras tries escaping from him at every juncture, only to end up with him again. While waiting for the train at the Ichchapuram railway station, Nalla begins to tell Aras his story.
A few years earlier, a healthy Nalla took part in various street theatre performances protesting against multinational corporation-driven industrialisation, which resulted in the marginalisation of the labour force. He was at odds with Kandasamy Padayatchi, a manipulative factory owner who refused to give his workers a raise. Nalla satirically imitated Padayatchi in many of his shows. In an unexpected turn of events, Nalla and Balasaraswathi (Bala), Padayatchi's daughter, fell in love with each other. To avoid a potential conflict with Padayatchi, the two decided to elope to Kerala.
Nalla boarded a bus bound for Kerala, and on his way to meet Bala, the bus met with an accident on a hillside, leaving him scarred, disfigured, and partially paralysed for life. After recovering from his wounds, he visited Bala only to be informed by Padayatchi that his daughter was already married and has settled abroad. Padayatchi had earlier lied to Bala that Nalla died in the accident. It was also at this time that Nalla became a firm believer in kindness and love. Despite suffering from an inferiority complex due to his scarred and deformed body, Nalla performs community service and social work with renewed fervour while continuing to fight for union causes.
Upon their arrival in Chennai, Aras delivers Nalla's cheque to the union workers. He invites Nalla to his wedding, where, to his utter astonishment, Nalla sees that Aras's bride is Bala. Padayatchi spots Nalla and asks him why he is at the wedding. He tells Padayatchi that he was invited by Aras, and later persuades him to sign the papers which will help Padayatchi's workers get a raise. To prevent the disruption of Bala's wedding and avoid damaging his own reputation, Padayatchi yields to Nalla's demands. After signing the papers, Padayatchi instructs his assistant to eliminate Nalla. However, his assistant has a change of heart as he is about to kill him. Padayatchi's assistant believes that the misdeeds he committed for Padayatchi resulted in the death of the assistant's daughter. Padayatchi's assistant requests Nalla to stay as far away from his boss as possible. Nalla assents and walks away."
765,Ankhon Dekhi,"Rajesh Bauji (Sanjay Mishra) is a man in his late 50s, living a dreary but eventful life in a small house in old Delhi with his extended family. The movie starts with Babuji narrating his dream where he sees himself flying like a bird free from all the worldly affairs. A random incident is going to change his life in a dramatic way, though he does not realise it at the moment. Bauji's daughter has been seeing a boy of ill repute. When that fact is revealed to the family, after much deliberation they decide to lock up the girl and go beat the wilful boy.
When they confront the boy, to Babuji he seems like a very nice person. This event radically changes his life — he decides that he will believe only what he can see, hence the title Ankhon Dekhi. After a while he refuses to worship god and treats prasad (offerings) as just another sweet. He is working as a travel agent and refuses to book tickets to Amsterdam as he has never seen Amsterdam. To uphold his ideals, he quits his job. He resorts to a very idealistic mode and takes things to extreme levels to explore his theory. At first his neighbours consider him a lunatic old man, but over time they start admiring his logical reasoning and start following him.
Once while intervening in a petty loan issue with a loan shark, he refuses to believe the bad reputation of the shark. He concludes that he is a good person, based on his observation. He forms a rapport with the loan shark and is recruited by him in his illegal gambling den. His followers join.
He gives consent to his daughter's marriage to the boy she loves and almost sorts out the emotional issues with his estranged brother.
Now free from all responsibility, he leads a life where there are almost no blind spots and a lot of clarity. He takes his wife for a vacation.
While chatting he narrates to his wife that he feels very light, like a bird flying in free skies. His wife jokes about his experience, inadvertently challenging his own theory that he doesn't know how a bird actually flies. In the middle of the night he walks towards a cliff. Babuji narrates his dream (as in the beginning of the story). He has yet to experience flying. As the film ends, Bauji is seen flying down a cliff."
766,Arising from the Surface,"The screenplay of this film is based on two poems, two essays and six short stories by Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh and the title of film is taken from one of his short story used in the film. The film is neither a biopic nor an adaptation, or an essay, nor fiction, and yet it engages with all these forms producing a cinematic text that defies any categorization. The narrative is fashioned around three characters: Ramesh (Bharath Gopi) who embodies Muktibodh's subjectivity where as Madhav (Jha) and Keshav (M. K. Raina) are his companions. All three saunter in and out of numerous mise-en-scène, driven by the political, philosophical underpinnings of Muktibodh's universe."
767,Arjun Reddy,"Arjun Reddy Deshmukh is a house surgeon at St. Mary's Medical College in Mangalore, India. Despite being a brilliant student, he has severe anger management problems that earn the wrath of the college dean. Arjun's aggressive nature also earns him a reputation among his juniors as a college bully. After a brawl alongside his friend Kamal against members of the opposing team during an inter-college football match the dean asks Arjun to either apologise or leave the college. Arjun initially chooses to leave the college, but stays back after meeting first-year student Preethi Shetty.
Arjun and his friend Shiva enter a third-year classroom and announce that Arjun is in love with Preethi and asserts that she is exclusive to him. Initially afraid, Preethi starts adjusting to Arjun's overbearing attitude. She eventually reciprocates his feelings and they develop an intimate relationship. Arjun graduates with an MBBS degree and leaves for Mussoorie to pursue a Master's degree in Orthopedic surgery. Over the course of three years, Arjun's and Preethi's relationship becomes stronger. Months later, Arjun visits Preethi's house, where her father sees them kissing and throws Arjun out.
Preethi's father opposes her and Arjun's relationship due to Arjun's brash behaviour and also because they belong to different castes. Arjun demands Preethi decide within six hours otherwise he will end their relationship. Following this incident, Preethi's parents seize her phone, preventing her from contacting Arjun. By the time she manages to visit Arjun's house, he is drunk, injects morphine into himself, and becomes unconscious for two days. Preethi is then forcibly married to someone from her caste. Arjun learns about the marriage from Shiva and goes to her house. He is assaulted and gets arrested for making a scene. Arjun's father throws him out of the family home for ruining his reputation.
With Shiva's help, Arjun rents a flat and joins a private hospital as a surgeon. To cope with his emotions, he starts taking drugs, attempts one-night stands, buys a pet dog and names it after Preethi and drinks alcohol; all of which are unsuccessful. Within months, he becomes a successful surgeon and a high-functioning alcoholic who is feared by the hospital's staff members, one of the reasons being his high surgery count. Arjun's self-destructing behaviour and refusal to move on worries Shiva and Kamal. He persuades one of his patients, Jia Sharma, a leading film star, to have a no-strings relationship with him, which he ends when she falls in love with him.
On a day off, Arjun unwillingly agrees to perform a life-saving surgery and collapses from dehydration. The hospital staff examines his blood samples, which show traces of alcohol and cocaine.

The pair marries, and Preethi's father apologises for misunderstanding their love for each other."
768,Bhuvan Shome,"Bhuvan Shome, a widower and a dedicated civil servant - strict, uncompromising - is a ""big officer"" in the Indian Railways. The background of the film is constructed in the context of a few railway ticket checkers discussing him as a strict, unreasonable officer (""afsar""). It continues with him being described, by the narrator, as a man whose ""Bengali""-ness has not been affected by his travels. His apparent age, late 50s, is an important element of his psychology.
Inspired by the idea of hunting, Bhuvan Shome takes a ""hunting holiday"" to Gujarat. It is quite clear that his expedition is amateurish. He is portrayed as an inept ""hunter"" rather than a man who knows how to acquire a skill.
His encounter with the young Gouri is fortuitous because it is she who takes care of him and helps ""hunt"" birds. She helps him through a barren wilderness, takes him home and takes care of him. When he is made to change his clothes because otherwise the ""birds will know"" and fly away is probably an important part of his transformation from a strict, conformist and aging man to one of a person more open to the stimuli of his environment.
The subsequent hunting sojourn of Gouri and Bhuvan Shome is a lyrical exploration of Bhuvan Shome's transformation. He is not only enamored by the simple beauty of Gouri, but also enchanted by the sights of birds on the lake and in the sky.
His hunt is ""successful,"" but only in a way that reflects Bhuvan Shome's limitations as a man.
Bhuvan Shome is deeply affected by Gouri, who is actually schooled more than he could expect to be in that environment.
When he returns to his office chambers, he is seen to reprieve an offending railwayman. This is a sub-plot that completes the story and context of the initial narration."
769,Chaitanya (film),"Chaitanya, is the chief mechanic for the upcoming Roots Challenge 1991 Automotive rally race – which starts via the route from Chennai coast to Goa coast, a route which is noted for illegal drug trade and arms trafficking. Retired Major Harischandra Prasad is the chief guest for the rally, and his daughter Padmini also competes for the Roots Challenge Trophy.
Chaitanya's journalist friend Sudhakar witnesses the murder of the city D.I.G. in a park. The D.I.G.'s murder happens to have been planned by an underworld gangster. Later, Sudhakar's murdered by a gang near his garage because he witnessed the murder of the D.I.G. Chaitanya finds himself beaten by the gang after he comes to the assistance of Sudhakar. When he regains his senses, he finds himself with a revolver in his hand and police custody, arrested and charged with the homicide of the friend he tried to assist. With evidence pointing toward his guilt, he has virtually no defense and may well spend the rest of his life in prison or be hanged. He manages to escape from the prison with the help of Chaitanya's garage assistant, Golconda (a drunkard), through the journalist's friend (Joseph) in a water tanker. Disguised as the journalist's friend, the gangster's henchman is hidden in the tanker.
The police commissioner, who is a close associate of Harischandra Prasad, attempts to solve the mysterious murder of D.I.G. and the journalist. The criminal's henchman plans to blast the water tanker and kill Chaitanya, who flees from Srungavarapukota prison in the same water tanker. But, after a battle with the henchman inside the water tanker, Chaitanya escapes and jumps from the water tanker into a lake, and the henchman dies in the water tanker explosion. Police send Chaitanya's case to CBI as they conclude that it was Chaitanya who was killed in the explosion. Chaitanya gets to participate in the One Halt Race by joining at a milestone on the route, in the guise of the garage assistant's race car. He finds out that the photographs of D.I.G.'s murder caught by his journalist friend are hidden in the three cars of the rally. In another twist, Padmini happens to drive the car in which 1 photograph was hidden.
How Chaitanya unweaves the mystery behind all this crime and how Padmini & Chaitanya fall in love in the process and identify the high-profile criminal adds to the rest of the plot and suspense in the film. The D.I.G. was killed by three people. According to the pictures, the guy in the brown coat is the police commissioner, who claims to be the gangster. The police commissioner forces Harischandra and Padmini to join the drug trade. Chaitanya manages to reach the commissioner's safehouse, where it's revealed that Harischandra's the high-profile criminal. Commissioner didn't know that someone else was the mafia, boss. Harischandra kills the commissioner. When Chaitanya shows up, he realizes that Padmini's father was the gangster who is responsible for the illegal drug trade, arms trafficking, DIG's murder, Sudhakar's murder, and ordered his gang to frame Chaitanya. The film ends with Chaitanya killing Harishchandra, the gangster when he attempts to shoot him."

The learned elder brother makes him realize the need to express his love and helps him write a love letter."
771,Chittagong (film),"The story is set against the backdrop of a little-known saga in 1930s British colonial India's East Bengal (now Bangladesh) where a group of schoolboys and young women, led by a schoolteacher Masterda Surya Sen (Manoj Bajpayee), dared to take on the Empire. Chittagong is the story of a diffident 14-year-old boy, Jhunku (Delzad Hiwale). Swept up into this seemingly impossible mission, the reluctant teenager battles with self-doubts to achieve an improbable triumph.
Jhunku, now a 23-year-old youth, is being chased by the Bengal police. He hides himself in a bunker with his childhood friend Aparna (Apu/Opu). While hiding, he begins to reflect on his past hopes and dreams. The story goes to a flashback to narrate the events that happened 10 years ago.
In 1930, Surya Sen and his followers are protesting the death of the revolutionary Jatin Das. Jhunku is not allowed to join them by his lawyer father who wants him to study in England. Apart from fearing his father, Jhunku is also torn between his admiration and respect for the magistrate, Wilkinson (Barry John) and his wife, who show great likings for him and his fascination for the charismatic figure of Masterda, who is followed and revered by most of his friends. Jhunku, due to his faith in Wilkinson who is personally against torturing revolutionaries, has great belief in British justice and believes that by getting an English education he might better equip himself to free his country. This causes arguments between him and his friends, especially Aparna. Wilkinson is opposed by the police inspector Major Johnson who defies his orders and arrests the protesters, and badly tortures Masterda.
In protest, some students hit the strict police officer Maj. Johnson (Alexx O'Nell) by spilling oil under his motorbike, making him fall. Enraged, Johnson makes random enquiries about the culprits but is unsuccessful. However, Wilkinson manages to confirm the truth out of Jhunku, and an enraged Johnson then shoots Sukhen (Shaheb Bhattacharya), one of the boys involved. This incident makes Jhunku an outcast amongst his friends, and he becomes determined to avenge the death of Sukhen. Soon afterwards, Johnson is made the DIG of police although Wilkinson had requested his transfer. This incident further shocks Jhunku. All his faith on his tutor Sir Wilkinson is lost, and he joins Masterda's army. Meanwhile, Pritilata Waddedar (Vega Tamotia) a school teacher by profession, is fascinated by the ideologies of Masterda and has great admiration for him. She wishes to join him in his future plans against the British Rule. She also appears to be in love with Nirmal sen (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) but he is reluctant to express his feelings.
Masterda and his comrades Nirmal Sen, Loknath Bal (Rajkummar Rao), Ambika Chakraborthy (Dibyendu Bhattacharya) and Ananta Singh (Jaideep Ahlawat) train the 50-odd students and plan to capture the city of Chittagong on 18 April 1930 by disconnecting all modes of communication. As per plan, the armoury of the police is captured by a group of revolutionaries led by Ganesh Ghosh and revolutionaries, led by Lokenath Baul takes over the Auxiliary Force armoury. Unfortunately the machine guns are not located. The revolutionaries also dislocate telephone and telegraph communications and disrupt the movement of the trains. After the successful raids, all the revolutionary groups gathered outside the police armoury where Surya Sen takes a military salute, hoisting the national flag and proclaims a provisional revolutionary government. The whole town is overjoyed at the success of Indian Republican Army and Chittagong is officially conquered by Surya Sen and his boys for one day. However, reinforcements from Calcutta soon set out to capture the rebels. Knowing of the army attack, the revolutionaries leave town before dawn and march towards the Jalalabad hill ranges, looking for a safe place. But the British Army's first wave is demolished by Masterda's teenagers. This enrages the British and they bring in machine guns. Harish also known as Tegra, the younger brother of Lokenath and a friend of Jhunku, dies.
Soon after revolutionaries disperse in smaller groups, to nearby villages. Ahsanullah Khan (Anurag Arora) from CID comes to Chittagong and cracks down on the revolutionaries. Jhunku is arrested and is severely beaten by Johnson and Ahsanullah during interrogation; he refuses to betray his leaders and comrades. He is sentenced to Kaala-Paani for life imprisonment. In due course, many revolutionaries and police officials are killed in the gun fights including noted revolutionary Nirmal Sen and police CID chief Ahsanullah. However, Pritilata Waddedar successfully attacks the Pahartali European Club and assassinates DIG Johnson; being gravely wounded she commits suicide by swallowing cyanide.
After a prolonged search, police search and arrests Master Da Surya Sen and sentences him to death by hanging. Thus Jhunku ends narrating the part and says that he was released in 1939 and again participated in the uprisings with Aparna. In one such incident there is a plan to attack the government godowns where the Britishers and feudal landlords have kept common peasant's grain. The British block all the roads to godowns leading Jhunku to an idea to create underground dungeons till the granaries. Twenty villages join hands and operate. The last scene shows Jhunku being stopped by Maj. Wilkinson who says he is still sympathetic to Jhunku and wants him to go away else he will be bound to arrest him once again.

779,Fandry,"Fandry is a fictional story set in the background of caste discrimination depicting the love of a 13-year-old boy.
Jambhuvant Kachru Mane, nicknamed Jabya (Somnath Awghade), is a pre-teen who lives in a makeshift house on the outskirts of a caste segregated village with his parents and 2 sisters (one a widow with a toddler). The family belongs to the Kaikadi community, an oppressed caste, and earns its living by doing menial jobs. Owing to the caste-ridden power structure of the village society, the boy's father has a fearful and submissive personality which is exploited by upper-caste villagers.
Jabya is disillusioned by the predicament of his family and shows interest in school where he has also fallen in one-sided love with a forward caste girl named Shalini (nickname: Shalu) (Rajeshwari Kharat) who he has never talked to but tries desperately to get her to notice him.
The plot opens with Jabya and his school friend Pirya (Suraj Pawar) armed with a slingshot trying to catch a bird (the Black Sparrow) in the wilderness. However, the bird call that punctuates the film is that of the Red Wattled Lapwing (Titawi), which is supposed to bring bad luck. The black sparrow, with its distinctive forked tail, and the call of the red wattled lapwing occur repeatedly throughout the film. The duo keep trying to catch the bird in the entire film for an unknown reason which is later explained in the film. According to a local legend, it is believed that when the ash obtained by burning the black sparrow is sprinkled on someone, it hypnotizes them to fall in love with the person sprinkling it.
Jabya also befriends a bicycle mechanic named Chankya (Nagraj Manjule) who sees his young self in the boy. Chankya had once married a girl but she was soon forcefully taken away by her brother and left him beaten very badly. Since then he has renounced family life and taken up refuge in spirituality, mysticism and liquor. Jabya seeks support from Chankya in his quest to obtain his love, which Chankya readily extends. Perhaps the idea of sprinkling the ash of black sparrow on Shalu is suggested to Jabya by Chankya himself. The idea, however, is executed only in Jabya's dream.

781,Ghazi (film),"In November, 1971, India and Pakistan are on the verge of declaring war on each other, as a result of the refugee crisis precipitated by the Pakistan Army under Operation Searchlight. The Indian Navy and RAW decipher a secret code sent from Pakistan to East Pakistan (modern-day Bangladesh), relating to a possible attack on an Indian naval vessel. The Navy deduces that the target may be INS Vikrant, India's sole aircraft carrier. The top command dispatches the submarine S21, under the command of  Captain Ranvijay Singh for recce missions. To temper Singh's belligerent tendencies, the Indian Navy Admiral assigns Lt. Cmdr Arjun Varma to S21, with orders to ensure that Singh does not confront any Pakistani warships and trigger a war.
The Navy's top command soon learns that the Pakistan Navy has dispatched PNS Ghazi, under Cmdr. Razak Khan, to the Bay of Bengal to confront  Vikrant. Meanwhile, to divert the attention of the enemy, Ghazi torpedoes an Indian merchant ship. The attack is picked by S21, which races to the scene. Noticing survivors in the wreckage, Arjun jumps into the sea and manages to rescue a girl child and a woman, both of whom are Bengali refugees. During surveillance, S21 acquires a sonar signal of Ghazi.
Singh believes that they should track down Ghazi and attack, while Arjun obstructs, reiterating his instructions. Singh then orders the ship's EXO, Lt. Commander Santosh Devraj to conduct a drill and target Ghazi while doing so, despite Arjun's protests. They fire a torpedo, which misses Ghazi narrowly, thus alerting them of their presence. Aware of the enemy's presence, Razak orders his crew to head towards Visakhapatnam Port at full speed and to set up mines en-route, planning to destroy S21.
S21 pursues Ghazi's path and realizes at the last moment that it is headed into mines. Singh and Arjun frantically attempt to change its course but a mine explodes in the stern and damages most of the sub's batteries, propellers and circuits. The sub blows open many leaks, with the forward torpedo compartment flooded, crippling the sub and barring it from firing its forward torpedoes. Singh dies while trying to save Arjun, as S21 sinks to the sea-bed.
Arjun, now in command of the sub, regroups and work towards reviving S21. They manage to clog the sub's leaks and pumps the excess water out, before holding a final farewell for Singh. The crew noticed that the vessel is incapable of moving in any direction, except upwards or downwards. Since they are unable to chase Ghazi, the crew artificially trigger one of the naval mines in its vicinity to lure Ghazi to their position. Razak, believing S21 is still operational, orders his crew to turn around to sink S21.
Arjun and Devraj plan to lure Ghazi within its range of firing, but a suspicious Razak orders Ghazi's course to be changed at the last minute.
Ghazi, now having the ability to attack S21, fires six torpedoes, all of which are avoided by S21 through depth changing maneuvers, much to Razak's frustration. S21 dives to 350 m, in order to slip from  Ghazi's sonar range despite being designed for a maximum of 250 m depth. With very limited battery support, Arjun instigates Ghazi into attacking by transmitting his crew singing 'Saare Jahaan se Achchha' and the Indian National Anthem. Riled up by S21's defiance, Razak orders another torpedo attack on S21, for which Ghazi will have to turn by port 180 degrees. Arjun dives into the flooded forward compartment to manually trigger the torpedoes, successfully managing to do so. Ghazi also launches its torpedo at the same time. The torpedo launched by Ghazi misses S21 narrowly, but it is hit by S21's torpedo and disintegrates in the water, killing the entire crew. S21 surfaces and the crew manages to save Arjun from the flooded compartment in the nick of time. S21 is later saved by a patrolling Indian Navy vessel.
The ending titles narrate the mysterious circumstances about Ghazi's fate, with its sinking credited to the actions of INS Rajput. It also mentions that in the aftermath of Ghazi's sinking, India and Pakistan had declared war on each other, which would ultimately result in India's victory, Pakistan's surrender and the creation of Bangladesh."

785,"Inshallah, Football","Inshallah, Football is about 18-year-old Basharat Baba, known as ""Basha"". His father, Bashir, was a much-wanted leader of the armed group Hizbul Mujahideen. When he left his home in Kashmir to join the training camps in Pakistan in the early 1990s, his son Basharat was barely two months old.
Basharat belongs to a new generation of Kashmiris, having grown up under the shadow of a protracted conflict. His passion is football, and he has been coached by Juan Marcos Troia, an Argentinean national and FIFA accredited football coach by profession. Marcos aspires to breed world class players from Kashmir; he and his wife, being attached to both Basha and Kashmir, migrate to Srinagar with their three daughters to take up Basha's cause.Marcos runs a football academy called International Sports Academy Trust; and an exchange program for his most talented players to train at Santos FC, Pele's old club in Brazil. Basharat was one of chosen few, but was denied a passport by the Government of India. The passport in question did come through after Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah intervened.Inshallah, Football tells this story through Bashir's recollections and travails.  Kumar describes the film as ""the story of three remarkable men – one is his father who fought for his beliefs, another about the football coach who's come all the way from Argentina to start this football academy, and this young man who is struggling to play football.""The film has been critically acclaimed and played in competition part of the wide-angle documentary section at the Pusan Film Festival where it also received the Asian Network of Documentary (AND) Fund,  and Winner of Muhr Asia Africa / Documentary /Special Mention : Ashvin Kumar (Director) at the Dubai International Film Festival"
786,"Inshallah, Kashmir","The film opens with ex-militants describing the torture they underwent when captured by the army. A Hindu describes his sentiment on being a part of the minority in the region at the height of militancy, when his grandfather was shot dead by militants. A politician and her husband describe the horror of being kidnapped and in captivity for over a month – and despite that, forming a human bond with the militants, and helping them escape when the army closed in on them. One understands from this section that militancy was not binary in nature. It was a dynamic and complex, resulting from various socio-political, economic and religious issues.
Disappearances and fake encounters led to the creation of mass graves, hidden away in sensitive border areas that civilians and journalists are not permitted to access in the name of national security. Human rights lawyer and activist Parvez Imroz reveals to us the presence of almost a thousand such graves in the valley. Rape victims from Kunan Poshpora describe the trauma they went through at the hands of the army and the stigma that they still face due to the incident.
The film also narrates how the minority Hindu Kashmiri Pandits were effectively cleansed from the valley as the majority of them fled the Islamic Terrorists. At several points in the movie, Kashmiri Muslims describe how the males are picked up and taken to Pakistan to be trained as terrorists. One former terrorist describes how his job will not be completed until Islam is spread through India and the World. He is prepared to die as he is firmly convinced he will go to heaven – though he cannot describe his concept of heaven. One Kashmiri woman openly admits that she sympathises with Pakistani Militants as they are Muslim. There are no interviews with the Indian Military in the movie.
The film then leads us to 'normalcy' or the social ramifications the last twenty years of devastation brought to the valley. Militancy in Kashmir resulted in the Government of India deploying tens of thousands of armed troops in the region. We hear the story of one boy who lost his leg because he was caught in crossfire. The film ends on a poignant note with a young artist saying 'I need my space.'"
787,Iruvar Mattum,"The film begins with an old couple going back to the forest to retrace their roots.
In a flashback, the hermit Azhagu (Abhay) lived in a wooden house in the forest. He ate only fruits and loved to take care of the wild animals. The carefree college student Selvi (Sunitha Varma) ran away from her house after her parents prepared her marriage with a man she did not like and she lost her way in the forest. Once night has fallen, she entered Azhagu's house to sleep and met the eccentric Azhagu. The next day, Selvi realized that he was different and loved his mother than anything. Selvi then begged him to get her out of the forest, but during the walk, the way was blocked by fallen trees and she turned back. Selvi stayed in Azhagu's house, and the two squabbled like children over small things, but they eventually fell in love with each other and Selvi could not leave the place. They decided to get married, so Azhagu introduced her to his mother, who turns out to be skeletal remains of her. A shocked Selvi tries to run away from Azhagu, but he abducted her and tied the knot with her. Selvi then tried to escape for a second time; during the run, she was wounded and Azhagu took care of her. Selvi tried to reason with Azhagu, but he became aggressive and strongly believed that his mother was still alive. Selvi made him believe that his mother will be reborn in her belly; thus, she became pregnant and gave birth to a baby.
Back to the present, the old couple is none other than Azhagu and Selvi. Selvi makes fun of Azhagu, who has now recovered from his mental illness, and they both laugh."

After a disastrous start, they are given some work by the editor of ""Khabardar"" (transl. Beware), a publication that exposes the scandalous lives of the rich and the famous. They accept it and start working with the editor, Shobha Sen, on a story exposing the dealings between an unscrupulous builder, Tarneja, and corrupt Municipal Commissioner D'Mello. During their investigation, they find out that another builder Ahuja who is Tarneja's business rival is also involved in this dealing to get a contract for building 4 flyovers from D'Mello. Next, the duo are assigned to secretly enter Tarneja's house and create a rift between Tarneja and Ahuja who will compromise on the contracts to be given to them from D'Mello. Vinod and Sudhir somehow successfully create a rift between the two by secretly informing Tarneja's assistant Ashok in the guise of Albert Pinto that Ahuja is actually Shobha's friend and wants to cheat Tarneja. The fight takes place until Tarneja's secretary Priya arrives with Assistant Municipal Commissioner Srivastav and tells them that D'Mello has given the contracts to neither Tarneja nor Ahuja but to someone else. 
While working on the story, Sudhir and Vinod decide to enter a photography contest that carries prize money of Rs. 5000/-, and take a number of photographs all over the city. On developing their pictures, in one of the photographs, they see a man shooting someone and after enlarging it, they realize that the killer is none other than Tarneja. They immediately return to the park where they shot that photo and eventually find out the crime scene. They find the body lying behind the bushes but before the duo can get to the body, it disappears, but they manage to retrieve one of a pair of gold cuff links. Sometime later, they attend the inauguration of a bridge dedicated to the memory of late D'Mello who is supposed to have died of a terminal disease. There they discover the other cuff link. They return at night and dig up the area and unearth a coffin containing the dead body of D'Mello.
They take several photographs of the corpse, and wheel it with them with the hopes of exposing Tarneja. However, the body disappears. They lie to Shobha saying that the body is hidden safely with them. Shobha, in turn, starts blackmailing Tarneja. He invites her, Vinod and Sudhir for dinner and plants a time bomb to kill them. Unfortunately, the bomb explodes after the three escape. They later find out from the news that the bridge built in the memory of D'Mello collapsed and the police are suspecting Vinod and Sudhir. The duo eventually find out about Shobha's blackmailing and after telling her the truth that the body is missing, the duo bid goodbye to Shobha after realizing that there's no difference between her and Tarneja.
Vinod and Sudhir find out that the body is with Ahuja who had, in an inebriated condition, carried the coffin to his farmhouse. They steal the corpse but not before Tarneja, Ahuja, Srivastav, Shobha and others also get involved resulting in a series of comic mix-ups.
The police arrive and Vinod and Sudhir present their evidence to the police officer. Srivastav tells the officer to wait a few minutes before arresting Tarneja. Tarneja tells Ahuja and Shobha that if he goes to jail, he would make sure that their malpractices are also exposed. In a twist ending, they all come to an agreement and Srivastav manages to pin the collapse of the bridge on Vinod and Sudhir. In the final scene, Vinod and Sudhir are shown several months/years later released from prison, still in their prison clothes. They turn to the camera and make a symbolic cut-throat gesture, signifying the death of justice and truth."

791,Kaun?,"On a gloomy night, a scared young woman (Urmila Matondkar) talks to her parents on the telephone, enquiring about when they will be back home. As she watches the news of a serial killer at large, the doorbell rings. The man outside identifies himself as Sameer Purnavale (Manoj Bajpai), claiming to be a business partner of the home owner, Mr. Malhotra. The woman is reluctant to open the door, due to the news of a killer on the loose. She says that the house doesn't belong to Mr. Malhotra, but instead to a Mr. Gupta. 
Believing that there has been a misunderstanding, Sameer persistently rings the doorbell even after the woman tells him that she won't let him in. To scare him away, the woman lies by saying that her husband is sleeping upstairs. Sameer says that he has indeed seen a man in the house, and requests to talk to him. Upon hearing this and a subsequent noise from within the house, the woman becomes scared and runs outside. Sameer then takes the woman back inside, reassuring her that he will protect her.
Due to a sudden power cut, the woman goes to the kitchen to look for candles, but instead finds her dead pet cat. Terrified, she runs to the door in a panic, only to find another man who is holding a gun. The man identifies himself as Inspector Qureshi (Sushant Singh) and calls the police station for help. 
Sameer and the woman are suspicious of Qureshi, and two men then get into a fight. During the struggle the woman gets hold of Qureshi's gun, forcing him to reveal that he is not actually a policeman, but a thief. The woman telephones her mother and asks her to contact the police.
Another struggle occurs, and Sameer gravely injures Qureshi, thinking that he is the serial killer. He picks up the telephone to call the police, however he finds that it is not working. Confused, he asks the woman to hide somewhere safe inside the house while he tries to fix the phone. The doorbell rings and Sameer answers. He calls out to the woman, saying that there was a man asking for Mr. Malhotra, but earlier she had insisted that the house belongs to Mr. Gupta. 
Bewildered, he searches for her in the attic, and stumbles upon a dead body, identifying it as that of Mr. Malhotra. The woman attacks him and they begin to struggle, until Sameer is suddenly stabbed by Qureshi, who believes that he is the killer. Whilst he checks on Sameer's body, the woman begins humming and stabs the thief to death.
The next day, the woman begins to remove the bodies, clean up the house, rearrange the furniture and proceeds to ""talk"" to her mother using the disconnected telephone, revealing her to be the serial killer. The doorbell rings and there is another man at the door, asking for Mr. Malhotra. The woman then turns to the audience and flashes an evil smile.
There are many mysterious elements in the film which remain unsolved. For instance, the murderer of the cat is never known in the film which adds to its suspense even more. Additionally, it was never known how the woman was committing so many murders in an unknown house which belongs to some Mr. Malhotra."

defies the governments, and Indian Border security paramilitary forces, and maintain a small army. He is wanted for killing approximately 184 people, about half of whom were police officers, including senior police and forest officials. He was also wanted for poaching about 200 elephants and smuggling ivory worth US$2,600,000 and about 10,000 tonnes of sandalwood worth approximately US$22,000,000.

796,Lucia (film),"There are two main roles, one that is played out in the dream, and the other one, in reality, called respectively Nikhil and Nikki. The plot starts with the protagonist being in a state of coma and continuing only on life support. The film, from the beginning, tells two stories of the same person, one in colour and the other in black and white.Sanjay, a detective from the Mumbai police Crime Branch starts investigating the incident that caused the protagonist's (Sathish Ninasam) current state. While Sanjay is going through the protagonist's belongings he stumbles upon some scribbled notes and a mysterious pill. Meanwhile, the police capture two suspects and interrogate them.
The story starts with Nikki in a village near Mandya, working as an usher/""torch-shiner"" in a Bengaluru movie theatre owned by Shankranna (Achyuth Kumar). Nikki has insomnia and yearns for a companion. On one of his sleepless nights, Nikki is contacted by a drug dealer who gives him Lucia pills as a solution to his sleeping problems. This drug is said to have the capacity to help one dream the life they want but has the side-effect that upon discontinuation the same dreams turn into nightmares.
With the help of the Lucia pills, Nikki starts seeing himself as being a successful actor called Nikhil surrounded by people he knows in the real world. Film actor Nikhil's life is depicted in black-and-white. Shankranna, the owner of the theater where Nikki works, had starred in a film in his youth funded by the leader of some goons who now want Shankranna to sign off his theatre for his debt. More events from the dream are followed by similar events in reality as Nikki falls in love with Shwetha (Sruthi Hariharan) who is a model in the dream and a waitress in reality.
In the dream, Nikhil and Shwetha hit it off easily at the beginning but later friction arises when Nikhil expresses his discontent about Shwetha working in the film industry. Meanwhile, in reality, Nikki struggles to win Shwetha's heart, who rejects him first due to his low salary but later falls for his humble character. Shwetha's attempts to get Nikki educated and lead him to find a better paying job turns out to be futile and also result in the death of Shankranna in the hands of goons. Frustrated, Nikki chooses to leave Shwetha and continue to work in the theatre, despite the threats. Nikki redecorates the theatre and releases Shankranna's film to the audience. He later reconciles with Shwetha, who agrees to marry him.
In the dream, Shankranna is kidnapped, and Nikhil rescues him with the help of the police. In the process, all of the goons are either arrested or killed except for the contract killer. Nikhil feels Shankranna is not safe with him and decides to fire him. Nikhil breaks up with Shwetha and sends off all his servants so as to be alone. Later, a visibly disturbed Nikhil finds himself in a trashed room. Nikhil gets hold of a torch and through its light sees his life as a ""torch-shiner"" projected on the walls of the room.
Shwetha is now distraught with being in the limelight and understands what Nikhil had tried to tell her. Nikhil, the actor, meets Shwetha and tells her that he cannot decide if the present moment is a dream or reality but he is ultimately happy. Asking Shwetha to close her eyes, Nikhil jumps off the roof to the confusion of everyone present, including the contract killer waiting to kill him.
At present, Sanjay with the help of the suspects performs a sting operation on the drug dealer and learns more about the Lucia pills. Meanwhile, Shwetha is caught in an attempt to kill Nikhil by pulling him off life support. During her interrogation, the whole investigating team along with Shwetha watches a re-run of an interview of the film star Nikhil. In the interview, Nikhil expresses his dissatisfaction of the stardom and reveals that he is actually color blind from an accident in his childhood. He tells the interviewer that he dreams of being a normal person and in fact, in one of his dreams he is a ""torch-shiner"" who gets no attention from people and is happily in love with the dream of his life. It also revealed that Nikhil and Nikki both had insomnia and both consumed the Lucia pill.
Sanjay is now convinced that Nikhil is living in his own version of reality and chose to live in that dream rather than in the real world by attempting suicide. Sanjay gets Shwetha to act and behave like she was in Nikhil's dream, and acts himself as if he was a contract killer and shoots the comatose Nikhil in the head with an empty gun. Simultaneously, Nikhil, aware and alive in his dream world finds everything disappearing around him and is killed by a shot to the head. Nikhi wakes up from his coma to see the astonished doctors and Shwetha's relieved face. Thus, revealing that the character Nikki was an illusion whereas Nikhil was reality.
At the end, we can see Nikhil, Swetha and Shankaranna (who was dead in Nikhil's dream) enjoying pizza (Swetha worked as pizza waitress in Nikhil's dream) while they operate the projector of an old theater. Thus revealing that it was film star Nikhil's dream to be a commoner like Nikki, and he achieved it through Lucid dreams."
797,Maa Bhoomi,"The film follows the story of a young landless Telangana peasant named Ramayya (Sai Chand) from Siripuram, Nalgonda, a region under foreign rule. The British have appointed the Nizam as the region's governor. The Nizam, in turn, has appointed the Reddys and the Patils as the Zamindars (known locally as Doras) of the region who collect taxes among various other things for the Nizam. Further, the Nizam has granted them with titles, Jagirs and judicial rights enabling them to seize thousands of acres of land from the peasants, turning them into tenants.
Ramayya rebels against the corrupt Nizam leadership in Hyderabad. When his wife has to submit to sexual coercion by the officials, he befriends the Communists and participates in the independence struggle. The peasants formed various paramilitary groups and launch guerilla warfare attacks across the region with country-made weapons. They raid and take over regional Dora bases across rural Telangana at night and burn all the land documents found in the bases in the open yard symbolising their triumph. Eventually, they take over the village after the Indian Independence.
The Doras manage to escape to Hyderabad reporting the events to the Nizam leadership. The Nizam commands the Razakars, a private Islamist militia, which perpetrates a massacre of the Telangana peasants. After months of burning, looting, rapes and killings, the Indian army marches into Hyderabad and suppresses the Razakars and the Nizam with Operation Polo in September 1948 and annexes the Telangana region back into the Indian Union. In independent India, the Zamindars (Doras) are returned to power by joining the Congress government. The Doras have abandoned the Nizam and pledged allegiance to the Congress Party."
798,Mirch Masala,"In the early 1940s, an arrogant subedar (Naseeruddin Shah) (local tax collector in colonial India) and his henchmen ride into a village, scaring a group of women fetching water. Sonbai (Smita Patil) alone stands her ground and politely asks them not to let horses into the village's potable water source.
Subedar settles into his camp and the Mukhi (trans. the chieftain) of the village visits him to pay respect. Subedar's gramophone is an object of fascination for the men of the village. Mukhi's frequent absence from home is resented by his wife. The schoolmaster (Benjamin Gilani), tries to get her to enrol her only daughter in the school. When she does, other women ridicule her. Mukhi pulls his daughter out and beats his wife for disobeying him. The mukhi's younger brother (Mohan Gokhale) is in love with a lower caste girl, but dares not mention it. When their liaison is found out, the girl's father beats her and tries get the mukhi to agree to a marriage. The mukhi rejects the proposal as unsuitable.
The subedar's men routinely loot the village for food, livestock and supplies. When mukhi brings a woman to him, he is disappointed that she is not Sonbai, but beds her nonetheless. He persists in wooing Sonbai, but when his demands turn forceful, she slaps him across the face and runs away. Enraged, he orders his soldiers to bring her. Sonbai takes refuge in a masala karkhana (spice factory where red chillies are ground into powder). Abu Mian (Om Puri), the wizened old Muslim gatekeeper and factory guard shuts the factory doors keeping the soldiers out. The subedar attempts to get the gates open through the factory owner and the mukhi fail. Abu Mian refuses to compromise on his job of providing security to the factory employees.
Subedar's threats of destroying the village prompt the mukhi to convene the village panchayat. The villagers hold Sonbai responsible for inciting the subedar and decide that she should yield to him. The schoolmaster points out that once they give in for one, there will be nothing to stop the subedar from demanding others, even perhaps the mukhi's own wife. Mukhi thrashes him and throws him out. Mukhi reports back to the subedar that they will hand over Sonbai on the condition that the subedar will not make further demands of this nature. The subedar laughs off this condition and has the schoolmaster tied up to a post.
The mukhi brings pressure on Sonbai, but she stands firm. Within the factory, the women who once supported Sonbai now turn upon her.

Ship of Theseus ends with the Platonic Allegory of the cave. The philosopher Plato argues that human beings are imprisoned in the cave of their own existence, falsely believing the temporary as having permanence. The job of a philosopher, he argues, is to help people find a way out of the cave.

811,Sindhooram,"A cadre of police constables on their way home from election duty. As they discuss their lives, their van is blown up by a gang of Naxals.
Bulliraju is in training to become a police officer. He is hot blooded and has a strong sense of justice. Buliraju is from a small village close to the Godavari river. Chanti, Bairagi, Satipandu and others are wayward youth who reside in the same village. They spend their time playing cards, drinking and teasing girls. They are all friends with Bulliraju. Few of them are also naxals and pass information of the ongoings of the village to Naxalites who live in the nearby forest. The Naxals use this information to fight injustice.
Baby and Lakshmi are girls in the same village. Baby is in love with Bulliraju and Lakshmi is in love with Chanti. Also in the village are various other characters such as landlords, policemen, doctors, farmers and day laborers.
Bulliraju returns in the middle of his police training to find that the local policemen act more like the henchmen of the rich rather than defenders of the people and justice. When Satipandu is suspected of being a closet Naxal and is picked up by the police, Bulliraju too is picked up too as he tries to defend his friend. The SI shoots and kills Satipandu and later in an altercation, Bulliraju accidentally shoots the SI. Buliraju is thus branded a Naxal and eventually becomes the leader of the group, despite having no interest in Communism/Maoism or Vigilantism. Bulliraju  brings a different approach to naxalism, as he is more focused on delivering justice to the people than spread a communist/Maoist ideology. In a way, he turns the Naxal gang into a vigilante gang. To the police however, they are all the same, as they have taken the law into their own hands. He becomes a symbol of law and order in the 30 surrounding villages and is seen as a form of alternate government.
Bulliraju's training officer is designated the task of wiping Naxalism from the area. He sees Bulliraju as an outlaw who joined police training to learn their secrets. He vows to bring Bulliraju to justice. One day, Bairagi is betrayed by an illegal arms dealer and is captured. Bulliraju kidnaps the local minister in an effort to get Bairagi back. Bulliraju's gang is already decimated by various forces such as poisoned water, police encounters, weather and the elements of the forest. They fight on even though that they are running out of ammunition. The police is on their trail for the kidnapping of the minister. Eventually, the police catch up to them and most of them die with heavy casualties on both sides.
The overall message of the movie is that when people have nothing to lose, they will not shy away from taking the law into their own hands. When the common man is denied justice from official channels, he will seek justice from whoever will give it to him. Justice is as important to the sustenance of a society as food and water. When justice becomes a luxury, society turns to chaos and death becomes a way of life. When a government doesn't provide the kind of justice that society needs, society will try to snatch it as a drowning man will grasp for air."

Aravind tries to speak to Adhikesavan and sort the issue, but the latter is too hesitant to speak with him. Aravind and his friend Sathish kidnap Adhikesavan and leave him in his son's house, making a close relationship.

Everyone in the town tries to adjust to living with not speaking. Aravind conducts the meeting with the Drinkers Association and Bhoomesh's fans, and they reconcile. A cure for the illness is invented, but if the virus has already infected but has not removed the voice of a person, the cure has a 50% probability of a side effect that the patient might lose the ability to speak. The film ends with everyone getting cured, but Sundaralingam, who has been faking the illness being given cure medicine on the stage for a photo op, loses his voice for real."

831,Bhumika (film),"Bhumika tells the life story of an actress, Usha (Smita Patil), who is the granddaughter of a famous female singer of the old tradition from the Devadasi community of Goa. Usha's mother (Sulabha Deshpande) is married to an abusive and alcoholic man. Following his early death, and over her mother's objections, Usha is taken to Bombay by family hanger-on Keshav Dalvi (Amol Palekar) to audition successfully as a singer in a Bombay studio: the first step in a process, watched approvingly by Usha's doting grandmother and with horror by her mother, that will eventually carry her to on-camera adolescent stardom, and to an ill-starred love marriage with Keshav. Usha's motives for stubbornly pursuing this relationship (culminating in a pre-marital pregnancy) with the unattractive and much older Keshav — who appears to have lusted after her since childhood — are not spelled out. Presumably, she either feels indebted to him for his loyalty to her family (of which he frequently reminds her) and for her own worldly success; or simply views him as a means to escape her abusive home. She is also a headstrong girl who clearly enjoys her acting career and is bent on challenging her uptight mother (who opposes the match because Keshav does not belong to their caste, just as she opposes cinema itself because of its presumed disreputability).
Once the two are wed, Usha is shocked to find Keshav continuing to act as her ""business manager"", arranging starring roles for her opposite heartthrob Rajan (Anant Nag), who is himself in (unrequited) love with her. Since Keshav's own business is unsuccessful, the family remains entirely dependent on Usha's earnings – a fact that Keshav clearly resents. He thus becomes both a jealous husband with a fragile ego and nasty temper, as well as (in effect) a greedy pimp who compels his wife to take risqué work despite her dislike of her co-star and her protests that she ""only wants to be a housewife"" now that their daughter has been born. Not surprisingly, the relationship becomes increasingly poisoned, particularly by Keshav's suspicion (fed by star-magazine gossip) that she is having an affair with Rajan, which is partly true. Verbally and physically abused by her husband and periodically obliged to live in a hotel, separated from her daughter and mother, the desperately unhappy actress eventually instigates two unsatisfying liaisons: with the nihilistic and self-centered director Sunil Verma (Naseeruddin Shah), with whom she plots a double-suicide (which he foils), and then with the wealthy businessman Vinayak Kale (Amrish Puri), who keeps her as a pampered mistress on his palatial estate. Here Usha briefly finds a kind of ""respectability"" as a de facto second wife, earning a measure of love and admiration from Kale's mother (Dina Pathak), son, and bedridden first wife — but (as she learns one day when she tries to take the boy to a nearby fair) at the cost of even the most rudimentary freedom. Unable to abide by Kale's feudal patriarchal rules, she finds her only hope of escape in the intervention of her still-legitimate husband, the hated Keshav, who promptly brings her back to a Bombay festooned with billboards of her own face, and to the same drab hotel and lonely prospects. As Kale's bitter wife remarks to Usha as the latter prepares to leave, ""The beds change, the kitchens change. Men's masks change, but men don't change."" Usha's daughter, now grown-up, invites Usha to live with her and her husband, but Usha refuses. The movie ends with Usha, alone in her hotel room, receiving a phone call from Rajan.

His methods seem harsh, including grueling early morning workouts and short forced haircuts. Despite facing backlash from the villagers, he goes ahead with them, training them in his makeshift mud pit. Initially, the girls resent their father for his treatment but soon realize that he cares for their future. Motivated, they willingly participate in wrestling tournaments where they defeat boys. Unable to afford wrestling mats, Mahavir uses mattresses and trains them in freestyle wrestling to prepare them for competitive events. Geeta goes on to win the junior and senior championships at the state and national levels before heading to the National Sports Academy in Patiala to train for the forthcoming Commonwealth Games.
Once there, Geeta makes friends and begins to disregard the discipline taught by Mahavir under duress from her coach Pramod Kadam, whose training methods and wrestling techniques completely differ from her father's. Therefore, she loses every match at the international level. During a visit home, she defeats a visibly exhausted Mahavir in a ferocious bout after egotistically mocking him. Babita reminds Geeta of her mistake and that she should respect Mahavir. Soon after, Babita wins the national championship and follows Geeta to the academy. After the two sisters have an emotional conversation in which Babita provides her encouragement, Geeta tearfully makes peace with Mahavir.
Before the Commonwealth Games, Pramod forces Geeta to compete in the 51 kg weight class rather than in her usual 55 kg. Irritated upon learning this, Mahavir goes to Patiala with his nephew Omkar and begins coaching the girls secretly. Learning about this, and furious with Mahavir's interference, Pramod wants the girls expelled; the sports authority issues a warning but allows them to continue. Mahavir is barred from entering the academy, and the girls are forbidden to go out. Determined to continue assisting his daughters, Mahavir obtains tapes of Geeta's previous unsuccessful bouts and coaches her by pointing out her errors over the phone.
At the games, competing in the 55 kg class, Geeta eases her way into the final. Mahavir constantly contradicts Pramod's instructions while sitting in the audience, and she follows her father's instructions instead. Just before the gold medal bout, jealous Pramod conspires to lock Mahavir in a room.
In the bout, Geeta manages to win the first session but loses the second. Trailing 1–5 in the final session and with nine seconds left, she recalls the tactics taught by her father and a 5-pointer, and executes it on her opponent in the final three seconds, taking the score to 6–5 in her favor, thus winning the session and the bout 2–1. In the process, she becomes the first Indian female wrestler to win gold at the Commonwealth Games. Mahavir returns just in time to embrace his daughters, dashing Pramod's hopes of obtaining credit before the news media."

858,Kaviratna Kalidasa,"The kingdom's chief minister wants his son to marry the king's daughter, Princess Vidyadhare. When he expresses his wish to the king, he is ridiculed. Instead, the king orders him to search for a ""Sakala Vidya Paarangatha"" groom for his daughter. Vowing to take revenge against the insult, the minister goes in search of a foolish groom.
Kalidasa, a humble shepherd is shown rearing his sheep. Convinced of his stupidity, the minister charms Kalidasa to accompany him to the palace, so that Kalidasa can marry the princess. Coached by the minister, Kalidasa excels in the tests conducted by Vidyadhare (Jaya Pradha). The minister is shrewd enough to teach a key sentence to Kalidasa. If he can't answer a question, Kalidasa must utter ""heluvudakku, keluvudakku, idu samayavalla"" (""This isn't the right time to question or answer."")
Vidyadhare is fooled by Kalidasa's brilliance and marries him. However, the truth comes out during the first night. Shattered, Vidyadhare locks Kalidasa in the palace temple and gets him to demand ""vidyaabuddhi"" (knowledge and wisdom) from the goddess Kali. In a mystical scene, Vidyadhare loses consciousness, while Kalidasa is blessed with vidyaabuddhi.  Kalidasa is shown walking away from the palace-temple, implying his casting off his earlier ignorance  and walking away from his previous life. Vidyadhare regains consciousness and goes in search of her husband.
Kalidasa, now a renowned poet, is one of the astadiggajas (eight great poets including Daṇḍin) in the court of King Bhoja (Srinivasa Murthy), much to the ire of the elder poet Musuri Krishnamurthy. Bhoja pleads with his dear friend Kalidasa to write a charama geethe (burial song) for him. Kalidasa refuses, since Bhoja is sure to die once he hears the song. Vidyadhare assumes the name Kaladhare, rests at a prostitute Ratnakala's home and catches Kalidasa's attention. Vidyadhare is pleased to see her husband, but Kalidasa is unaware of his former life. Kalidasa composes his best work Abhignaanashaakuntala with romantic interests on Vidyadhare.
Bhoja can't bear the fact that his aptamitra (intimate friend) Kalidasa is in the company of a prostitute. The differences lead to Kalidasa parting ways with Bhoja and walking out of his court. Dimdima kavi, who is blessed with a dindima from the goddess Saraswati, throws a literary challenge to Bhoja's ashtadiggajas, asking them to complete his shloka with the answer. Bhoja recalls his friend, when none can answer the question, kamale kamlotpattitih (lotus is born in a lotus). Shamed Bhoja announces that he will donate half of his kingdom to anyone who solves the puzzle.  Ratnakala gets the answer from Kalidasa and poisons him. She walks into royal court, to claim half kingdom. She answers, ""Eye lotuses in the face lotus of my lady.""
Dimdima kavi, who could silence herds of laureates with his dimdima, catches her fault, asking when she herself is a lady, how can she say ""milady."" He announces that other than Kalidasa no one can answer this puzzle. Bhoja rushes the guards to Kalaadhare's house, only to find the dead body of Kalidasa. Bhoja also learns the truth from Vidyadhare: Kalidasa was her husband. Bhoja pledges to Vidyadhare that he'll get her husband back to her and prays to the goddess Kali to donate his half life to Kalidasa. When Kalidasa awakens, Bhoja hides himself and tricks him to sing ""charama geethe.""  Bhoja dies once his friend has completed the song.
The onus is now on Kalidasa to get his friend back to life; the only way is the divine intervention. He prays his heart out to the goddess Kali, who is touched by the love and affection Kalidasa and Bhoja bestow on each other. The goddess blesses both Kalidasa and Bhoja with long lives. The movie ends with Kalidasa reuniting with Vidyadhare."

Veerappan gang plants landmines on the road in more than 14 places to halt their approach, and during the Palar blast, K.Gopalakrishnan, standing on the foot board of the jeep is thrown out, and suffer severe injuries, leaving the police to retaliate and ultimately prevent the snatching of arms.
After few failed attempts, including the one led by another undercover cop (Gundragovi Satya), disguised as a subordinate to Muslim underworld Don-Kadaani (Ramesh Pandit), to negotiate arms deal with Veerappan's gang, the STF team led by master-strategist, and an ex-spy turned timberyard owner-Kumar (Srikanth Iyyengar), finally succeed on 18 October 2004.

865,Mahanati,"During the year 1980, a popular yesteryear actress Savitri is found unconscious by her son. She is hospitalized, spending a year in a coma. The incident receives media attention but Savitri's initial life and whereabouts remain unknown to the public. Madhuravani, a stuttering journalist, and Vijay Anthony, a photographer, are appointed to write an article about her situation. Madhuravani recovers a letter written by Savitri, in which she wishes to take her son to someone called ""Shankarayya."" Though she is later relieved from writing the memoir by her editor, Madhuravani continues her research curiously. She sneaks into Savitri's house and overhears her aunt talking about her childhood.
In Vijayawada, 1942, a widowed Subadrama and her daughter Savitri are taken in by Subadrama's sister, Durgamba, and her husband, KV Chowdary, much to the latter's chagrin. Savitri grows up to become an accomplished dancer and earns a profit for Chowdary by acting in plays with her friend Susheela. The increasing popularity of cinema leads to less attendance for plays, and Chowdary incurs huge losses. He tries to have Savitri join the film industry based in Madras but her young age and inability to speak Tamil hinder her prospects. She, however, meets Ramasamy ""Gemini"" Ganesan, a studio employee who takes her photograph for a casting director. A year later, Savitri is cast in a film directed by L. V. Prasad but she gets the dialogue wrong and is thrown out. However, she earns a dancing role for a song in the film Pathala Bhairavi. Her performance in that film helps her in getting major roles.
Savitri is offered a role opposite Ganesan, now an actor, who teaches her Tamil language. They together rise as superstars and Savitri falls in love with the married Ganesan. They secretly marry at a temple, which leads to a clash with Savitri's family. Despite being reluctant to act after marriage, Savitri is persuaded by the filmmakers and Ganesan. She goes on to become a successful actress. Savitri later gives birth to two children– a girl and a boy. Ganesan is initially supportive of her career, however, he feels jealous of Savitri as her fame overshadows his.

Feeling cheated, Savitri angrily part ways with Ganesan. She becomes an alcoholic and gains weight. Meanwhile, her mother dies, and poor financial decisions lead to a raid by the Income Tax Department, resulting in the loss of her wealth. One day, Savitri fights with her daughter about her excessive alcohol consumption and faints, accidentally setting their house on fire. They learn that Savitri has diabetes.
As Chowdary visits Savitri, she asks both her daughter and uncle for forgiveness. She gets her daughter married, stops drinking, and loses weight. She shifts to a smaller house with her son and starts acting in low-budget films. She sets aside money for opening a rehabilitation center. Upon knowing that she still owes income tax, she strongly refuses to part with any more money. She goes to Bangalore with her son the next day. Feeling lost, she calls Ganesan but cuts the line before speaking. Angry with him and with herself, she consumes alcohol again, before collapsing into a coma.
Madhuravani realizes her love for Anthony via Savitri's story. She interrupts what is supposedly Anthony's engagement and speaks strongly without a stutter, only to realize that is his sister's engagement and that Anthony too loves her.

868,Major (film),"The movie starts with Sandeep Unnikrishnan entering the POK, which the Pakistani Army considers a threat and orders him to retreat. When questioned by the Indian Army Officials on why he did it and that the area belongs to Pakistan, he replies ""It is ours"". Young Sandeep grows up with his sister, Sandhya, and his parents K. Unnikrishnan and Dhanalakshmi, in Yelahanka, Bangalore. As a child, he was very curious about the world around him. When Unnikrishnan took him to see a Navy ceremony with military airplanes flying in the sky Sandeep developed an early fascination with the life of a soldier. In his later years as a secondary school student, Sandeep falls in love with his classmate, Isha. Sandeep applied to join the Indian Navy without telling his parents, much to the fury of Unnikrishnan. However, the Navy ultimately rejected Sandeep's application, causing Sandeep to ultimately join the army. As the years progressed Sandeep rose up the ranks to become an NSG training officer.
In 2008, Sandeep is well established in his career as a training officer for the 51 Special Action Group of the NSG and is married to Isha, but their marriage is in trouble. Sandeep asks for leave to try and save his marriage. On the same day as Sandeep's leave though, Pakistani terrorists arrive in Mumbai by boat and they proceed to orchestrate deadly attacks in the city. Desperately crowds start heading to the Taj Hotel for safety but the terrorists also enter the hotel and start shooting at staff and guests indiscriminately. The local police are called to the scene but they are ill-equipped to deal with the threat. Upon discovering the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, Sandeep requests Commander Shera to allow him to participate in the NSG mission to neutralize the terrorist threat. They leave for Mumbai and commence the military counterterrorism operation: Operation Black Tornado, but the NSG encounters a vast number of obstacles and problems upon arriving at the scene. They lack surveillance cameras to discover the number of people inside the building. 
The terrorists have installed deadly booby traps and trip wires with bombs throughout the premises. Several hotel staff and guests end up crowded together in a locked room, all bound and gagged on the floor. To make matters worse there is an intrusive media circus swarming outside the hotel reporting the NSG's known operations and movements, information which ultimately proves useful to the terrorists. Meanwhile, a guest named Pramoda Reddy, who is trapped on the fifth floor, manages to keep herself hidden from the gunmen. She ultimately takes responsibility to rescue British tourist's young daughter, named Shirley. Sandeep talks to Isha over the phone. She is applying for divorce and scolds Sandeep for not being there with her when she had a miscarriage, but she is horrified when she discovers that Sandeep is at the Taj Hotel. As the NSG rescue more hostages (several of whom remain tied up inside a locked banquet hall) and starts closing in on the remaining terrorists, Pramoda calls the downstairs lobby using a walkie-talkie from one of the dead security guards. 
Sandeep ultimately decides to go to the 5th floor to save them, saying that he would never be able to forgive himself if he did not save her. His colleagues subsequently use tear gas and Sandeep races up to the 5th floor. He ultimately rescues Pramoda and Shirley and heroically kills some of the terrorists. However, when his CO asks him whether he needs reinforcement or not, he refuses. His last words are ""Do not come up, I will handle them."" But as fate would have it, he is killed in action, laying down his life for his country. Major Sandeep's parents watch in horror as the news coverage shows that Sandeep was killed in action. They had thought that since Sandeep was a training officer he was not involved in the rescue mission at the Taj Hotel. After his death, there is a large military funeral and a crowd of well-wishers gather to mourn Sandeep's passing. Isha is devastated at Sandeep's death and discovers that he never signed the divorce papers. Later, a 10-year commemoration ceremony in 2018 honoring the lives taken during the attack is held at the Taj Hotel. During the commemorations, Pramoda is reunited with the Shirley whose life she had saved. Mr. Unnikrishnan gives an impassioned speech in which he says that Sandeep should be remembered not for how he died, but for how he lived. 
As Unnikrishnan recalls during his speech, a flashback shows the continuation of the beginning of the movie. It is shown that Sandeep was playing cricket with the children from Pakistan, and when he was called back, he waves goodbye and promises the children that he would come to play another time."
869,Manjunath (film),"In the hinterland of Uttar Pradesh 27-year-old Manjunath Shanmugam is a student at the state-of-the-art campus of the Indian Institute of Management Lucknow (IIM-L). After graduating, Manjunath joins a petroleum company as a sales officer. He is posted in Lakhimpur Kheri, a remote district in rural Uttar Pradesh. One day Manjunath goes missing.
His friends panic, because they know that of late he had been very disturbed and was behaving strangely. He had become serious and scared. He was different from the Manjunath they knew in college, who was always jovial, fun-loving, friendly, and a great entertainer.
One of his friends finds him, but Manjunath is frantic. They send him back to his hometown. Manjunath's parents try to convince him to leave his job at Bharat Oil that is causing him stress. Initially he seems willing but slowly he realises that he doesn't want to be a quitter. (Manjunath believes that, being from a top institute in the country, he has been given an opportunity. As the eldest son of a mineworker, he has had a humble upbringing.)
He realises that the kerosene, mixed with diesel, is coming from ration shops — 'it's the poor people's kerosene'. In addition, he becomes conscious of the extent of pollution caused by burning adulterated fuel. He finds strength and comes back to fight, against his parents wishes.
There is a clear threat to his life, because he insists on doing his duty to stop petrol adulteration. This time, Manjunath is not deterred. He continues doing what he considers right, without worrying about the consequences. As a result, one night he gets brutally killed by the people who are harmed by him doing his duty. His family and friends suffer over his death. They wonder why he put himself in so much danger.
Slowly, the worst fears start coming true. Beyond the initial grief, no one wants to come forward to carry on the fight.
In the film, Manjunath is shown watching what happens after he dies. He is starting to feel that it is all pointless. He cannot watch his parents' tears any more: What was their fault? Maybe he should have compromised. But how can people not see what he has? What he fought was something very big and very important.
Suddenly, people who have no connection to him realise the importance of what Manjunath did and start trying to do something. Like novices, they search their way around: Their will is strong. They start getting help again from unexpected quarters. It is nerve-wracking, with dangers for everyone. Then, instead of one or two, there are a lot people helping. Manjunath, who has lost hope, realises that it's not all going waste.
He hopes and prays that they succeed.
The film cuts back and forth from a rock concert. The conflict of the story is not whether Manjunath lived or died, but if the effect of Manjunath lives or dies, and in the end that's the victory."

873,Meera (1945 film),"During the reign of the Mughal emperor Akbar, young Meera, influenced by the story of Andal and Krishna, is deeply in love with Krishna, so much so that she considers him to be her husband after she garlands him on an auspicious day as advised by her mother. As Meera matures into a young woman, her devotion to Krishna grows.
Against her wishes, Meera is married to Rana, the king of Mewar. But even after marriage, her love for Krishna remains unchanged. She follows her own ideals and way of living which are unacceptable to Rana and his family, especially his brother Vikram and sister Udha. Meera asks Rana to construct a temple for Krishna in Chittor, the capital of Mewar. Out of love for her, Rana agrees. An overjoyed Meera remains in the temple most of the time, singing in praise of Krishna along with other devotees, and avoids staying at the palace.
On Vijayadashami, Rana expects Meera to be with him at the royal assembly when other kings come to offer their respects. But en route to the assembly, Meera hears Krishna's flute playing, returns to the temple and remains there. Rana becomes angry upon realising that Meera has returned to the temple again, ignoring her duties as a wife. To kill Meera, Vikram has Udha give her a poisoned drink. Meera is saved by Krishna and the poison does not kill her; instead, Krishna's idol at the Vithoba Temple turns blue, and the sanctum's double-doors at Dwarakadheesh Temple close spontaneously, and remain closed.
At Delhi, Akbar learns of Meera's singing and her devotion to Krishna. He sends her a pearl necklace as a gift, which Meera puts on Krishna's idol. Rana becomes angry when he learns of these developments and her disinterest in fulfilling her duties as a wife and queen; he orders the demolition of the temple using cannons so that she will leave. Vikram goes to the temple and orders Meera and the other devotees to come out before the demolition begins. However, Meera refuses, remains in the temple and continues her bhajans.
Meanwhile, Rana learns from Udha of Vikram's failed attempt to kill Meera. Shocked when he realises Meera's real identity (she is one with Krishna), he rushes to meet her in the temple, which is about to be demolished. When a cannon is fired, Rana stops it and is injured. When Meera hears Krishna calling her, she admits to Rana that she has failed in her duties as a wife. She explains that her heart is with Krishna and seeks Rana's permission to leave palace life and fulfill her desire to visit Krishna's temple at Dwarka; Rana realises her devotion and agrees. Once Meera leaves, Mewar suffers from a drought and the subjects plead with Rana to bring Meera back, so Rana goes in search of her.
Meera first goes to Brindavanam and meets the sage, who originally predicted her devotion. Together, they leave for Dwarka, Krishna's birthplace. On reaching the temple, she starts singing in praise of Krishna. Rana, who has followed her, also reaches the temple. The temple's doors, which were closed till then, open. Krishna appears and invites Meera inside. Meera runs towards Krishna and falls dead while her soul merges with him. Rana comes rushing in and finds Meera's corpse.

876,Naache Mayuri,"Mayuri is a real story of Bharatanatyam dancer Sudha Chandran, who lost her leg in an accident on her way to Trichy to Chennai in June 1981. The story depicts how she received an artificial Jaipur foot and eventually learned to dance again, triumphing over her fate, and ultimately becoming very successful in her life."
877,Neerja,"22-year-old Neerja Bhanot arrives late for a house party one evening. Her mother, Rama, expresses concern about Neerja's job as a flight attendant, suggesting that Neerja should return to her old modelling career. Neerja insists on keeping her job. She is driven to the airport by her friend Jaideep.
During the flight, Neerja reflects on her brief, unhappy arranged marriage to Naresh, a professional in Doha, Qatar, who abused her over her small dowry and inability to perform household work. She eventually returned home for a modelling contract. Naresh sent her parents a letter complaining about the dowry and their daughter's lack of domestic skills, demanding that Neerja either bring back the money or not return it at all. Neerja left Naresh and landed a job with Pan Am Airways.
As Neerja boards Pan Am 73, it is meanwhile revealed that the Abu Nidal organisation, a Libyan-sponsored Palestinian terrorist group, plans to hijack the plane in Karachi. The plane takes off from Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport and lands in Karachi's Jinnah International Airport, where the four Abu Nidal terrorists, disguised as security officers escorting a Libyan diplomat, hijack the plane. Neerja quickly alerts the cockpit, without the terrorists knowing, and the three American pilots escape through the overhead hatch, fleeing to the terminal under fire from the hijackers. The American pilots had just enough time to escape, as the hijackers did not realise that the cockpit of a Boeing 747 is located upstairs.
When a Kenyan-born Indian American passenger reveals himself as an American, one of the terrorists murders him and dumps his body off the aircraft in front of the Pakistani negotiators. The terrorists try to locate a radio engineer among the passengers by ordering Neerja to make an announcement over the intercom. When Imran Ali, a Pakistani radio engineer, begins to stand up, Neerja signals for him to sit down. The terrorists have the flight attendants collect all passports to identify the American passengers and hold them hostage; Neerja and her colleagues collect the passports, disposing of any American passports by throwing them down trash chutes or hiding them under seats. Dejected over not finding any American passports, the hijackers instead take a British passenger hostage.
The Pakistani negotiators inadvertently reveal the name of radio engineer Ali, whom the hijackers bring to the cockpit to use the radio for negotiations. Meanwhile, the Pakistani authorities try to stall for time. When a younger terrorist assaults the passengers and molests the attendants, the terrorist leader chastises him; humiliated, the younger terrorist storms into the cockpit and shoots Ali, screaming wild threats over the radio. While negotiations with the Pakistani air controllers drag on, the negotiators slowly lose control of the situation, with the hijackers becoming more agitated by the minute. Meanwhile, Neerja, who had her birthday 2 days later, had an envelope and when she has kept away from other passengers, opens that envelope given to her by Jaideep, her friend, which was his love confession and a cookie, Neerja reads that and eats that cookie which symbolizes her acceptance of his love, but on a little sad note Jaideep never gets to know that she has accepted his love.
Around 17 hours later, the plane loses auxiliary power, and the lights go out inside the plane. Despite Neerja and the other attendants' attempts to explain, the terrorists assume the Pakistanis cut the power deliberately, and anticipate an imminent Pakistani raid on the plane. The panicking hijackers begin shooting down passengers indiscriminately; at great peril to her own life, Neerja opens the emergency exit door and deploys the chute, directing passengers out of the plane. Choosing to let the passengers escape first, Neerja is shot three times by a terrorist as she tries to shield three young children from the gunfire. The children escape the plane, and Neerja then drags herself out of the doorway and down the emergency slide before dying. The Special Service Group storms the plane and kills all the terrorists.
The film ends with a tribute to Neerja, who was eventually honoured posthumously with the Ashoka Chakra, India's highest military decoration awarded for peacetime valor, courageous action or self-sacrifice."

He surprises his seniors in the Army with his athletic skills. Though he was not interested in sports, he joined the sports division because there were no limits on their diet.

He participates in the Indian National Games and wins the gold medal in the steeplechase event 7 years in a row.

The police continue their search for Paan Singh Tomar, who, as a result of which, decides to lie low for a while. He meets his family and his coach from the army who requests him to surrender.

When the gang reconvenes after a month's hiatus, one of the members, Gopi (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), who had turned into a police informer betrays the gang by leading the police to their hideout.

887,Raja Desingu,"Raja Swaroop Singh Bundela won the respect and loyalty of the people of Senji during his rule, where Hindus and Muslims lived in peace and prosperity. A son was born to Swaroop Singh and his wife Rambai Bundela, whom they named Tej Singh Bundela pronounced as Desingu in Tamil. Swaroop Singh has a secret Muslim concubine called Jaan Bibi, and they have a son called Dawood Khan, who was a little older than Desingu. Fearing that Dawood might pose a threat to the succession of the throne in years to come, on the advice of his commander and close confidant Yusuf Khan, Swaroop Singh persuades Jaan Bibi to leave Senji, taking little Dawood with her. Desingu, who has integrity and courage grows up with his childhood friend, another brave young man called Mohammed Khan, and two are always inseparable.
At this juncture, the Sultan of Delhi offers to free any state coming under his dominion whose ruler manages to tame a wild horse in his stable. Hearing this in the intention to have a free kingdom, Swaroop Singh leaves to Delhi without letting know Rambai and Desingu. Despite trying very hard, he failed to tame the wild horse and was imprisoned by the Sultan of Delhi. Upon hearing this, the minister informs Desingu, who rushes to Delhi where he meets his uncle Bheem Singh Bundela for advice. The dauntless Desingu manages to tame the stallion and ride it, to the loud cheers of the huge audience. Filled with admiration, the Sultan frees Swaroop Singh, who had earlier failed in this endeavour and gives them a written proclamation of Senji's independence. Desingu marries Ranibai Bundela, who is Bheem Singh's daughter. Pandiyan, who works in the horse stable comes along to Senji and works as assistant to Mohamad Khan's father and falls in love and marries Sengkamalam, who is also Mohamad Khan's adopted sister.
Meanwhile, growing up as an illegitimate child, Dawood vows to rule Senji some day. But on her deathbed, Jaan Bibi extracts a promise from Dawood that he would not cause any harm to Desingu. Dawood goes to Arcot and wins the confidence of the Nawab, when he rescues the Nawab's infant son from being crushed under an elephant's feet. The grateful Nawab appoints him as his general. When Dawood expresses his determination to subjugate Senji, the Nawab expresses his helplessness, stating that nothing could be done as long as Desingu has the written proclamation of Senji's independence in his custody. It is around the same time that Desingu dismisses his general Yusuf Khan from service when he is caught trying to commit adultery molesting Sengkamalam. Abetted by the humiliated Yusuf Khan who has now turned traitor, Dawood makes use of his striking resemblance to Desingu and extracts the written parchment from the unsuspecting wife of Desingu.
When Mohammed Khan falls in love with the pretty Ayisha, he anticipates no opposition from his parents for the match. However, he finds that his mother and father have each identified a girl of their own choice to be his wife. When he informs them that he has already chosen his life partner, his father proposes that they go the queen for an appropriate decision. Ranibai asks each of them to write down the name of the girl they have in mind, and then discovers that all 3 of them have written Ayisha's name.
When the royal astrologer suggests that Desingu and Ranibai be separated for 3 years as an antidote for the inauspicious placement of their stars, Desingu pours scorn upon such beliefs. However, considering the welfare of Senji and heeding to his mother's plea, Desingu is forced to consent to such separation. He carries on stolidly with his responsibilities as the ruler of Senji during the day.
The Nawab of Arcot and Dawood Khan send a man to meet Desingu to request Senji kingdom to pay tax. Desingu announces in agony that Senji would not bow to the Sultanate of Delhi. Now that Senji had no proof of its independence, Arcot declares war on Senji for non-payment of taxes. Under the resolute leadership of Mohammed Khan, Senji emerges triumphant in warding off the Arcot forces. But even as Mohammed Khan fetches water to quench the thirst of a dying soldier of Arcot, Yusuf Khan shoots him from the back. And not satisfied with dastardly act, Yusuf Khan kills Mohammed Khan's fiancée Ayisha, who had come to the battlefield in search of her beloved. Wanting the brothers to fight against each other now, Yusuf Khan carries false reports to Desingu that it was Dawood who killed Mohammed Khan. Thirsting for revenge for the death of his friend, Desingu rushes to the war front and soon challenges Dawood to a duel. Dawood is hesitant to fight with his brother, and even advises Desingu that they could leave the fighting to their troops. But Desingu is no mood to listen and soon the brothers are engaged in a bitter duel. Handicapped by his oath not to harm Desingu, Dawood is soon vanquished and lies mortally wounded. Desingu's delight is short-lived, for Yusuf Khan now informs him that Dawood is none other than his brother. Adding to his grief at the death of his friend, Desingu is horrified at having killed his brother, and in a moment of abject remorse, kills himself."
888,Rajmata Jijau,"Rajmata Jijau tells the story of Jijabai's life, beginning with the return of the child Shivaji to Pune, and in the process depicts Jijabai as a heroine in her own right, largely responsible for the formation of Shivaji, and therefore, for his accomplishments as founder of the Maratha empire."
889,Rakta Charitra,"Narasimha Reddy, a local politician, is a powerful man in the area. His close associate Veera Bhadra (Rajendra Gupta), is his trustworthy ally for his political work, to the extent that Narasimha Reddy gives him the freedom to contest Jilla Parishad polls with his men. Veera Bhadra champions the causes of the poor and oppressed, and they look up to him like their leader.
Nagamuni Reddy (Kota Srinivasa Rao), who is the local MLA of the district and close to Narasimha Reddy, becomes jealous of the budding trust between Veera Bhadra and Narasimha Reddy, and starts poisoning Narasimha Reddy against Veera Bhadra. Narasimha summons Veera Bhadra and asks him not to contest the polls with his contestants, but rather support Nagamuni Reddy's. Veera Bhadra lashes out at Narasimha Reddy for being unfair to the underprivileged communities and storms out. Nagamuni Reddy calls for Manda (Ashish Vidyarthi), a close follower of Veerabhadra, and manipulates him into killing Veerabhadra, giving him the assurance that if he does it, people will suspect the policies of Veera Bhadra as his own follower killed him and he will be the next in line as the leader of the poor people, else take his life. Manda reluctantly agrees to it. Veerabhadra and his wife (Zarina Wahab) travel in a bus with 40 people to a wedding. Manda and Nagamani's men stop the bus, kill Veerabhadra's guards, and tell him to step out of the bus or else he will be killed along with the other innocents on the bus. Veera Bhadra comes out, looking at Manda, and dares him to kill. Nagamani's henchman Durga shoots at Veerabhadra, making it look like Manda shot at him; prompting Manda about the deal he made with Nagamani, he tells him to kill him in front of everyone. Manda takes a boulder and crushes Veerabhadra's skull, and kills him.
This results in an agitation led by Shankar, who wants to avenge his father's murder by killing all the men of Nagamani and Narasimha Reddy. Enter Nagamuni's son Bukka Reddy (Abhimanyu Singh), described as a ruthless man who enjoys raping women and killing men in brutal ways. He starts killing Shankar's men in gory ways: drilling a hole into their skull, chopping off their heads with a sugarcane chopper, burning them alive and feeding them to ravenous rats.
Pratap Ravi (Vivek Oberoi), who is in college in the city of Anantapur, gets the news of his father's murder and rushes to the village. Nagamani Reddy orders the local police inspector to kill Shankar in a fake encounter. When Pratap Ravi goes to the police station to ask about his brother, the inspector shows him Shankar's dead body and mocks him. Infuriated with his brother's murder, Pratap Ravi and Veerabhadra's men kill all the police officers and the inspector.
Pratap Ravi hides in the jungle with his father's associates and vows to kill Narsimha Reddy, Nagamuni Reddy and Manda one by one, instilling fear of death in each one of them. He starts by busting into the house of Narasimha Reddy, killing his guards and finally killing him with a scythe in front of his wife as she looks on in horror. Next is Manda; as he roams in the market, Pratap's men follow him, and before he can defend himself, they chop his hand off. Manda begs for his life, but Pratap stabs him in front of everyone. They plan to kill Nagamuni Reddy, but they are cautious as there is heavy police security in his house. As Nagamani Reddy is sitting on his lawn conversing with a police officer, he is shot at by Pratap, who is dressed as the cop, and his men, dressed as cops as well, kill most of the policemen.
The story progresses as famed film star-turned-politician Shivaji Rao targets Anantapur for contesting elections. The day he enters Anantapur for the rally, Bukka Reddy's men throw bombs, which makes Shivaji Rao get back inside the car and go back. This insults him greatly, and he asks his secretary for the one who can stop Bukka Reddy. Immediately, his secretary mentions Pratap Ravi's name; Shivaji Rao sends for him and puts down a proposal of joining his party and ticket for contesting elections. On the other hand, Bukka Reddy makes his brother Puru Reddy contest for elections and tries to sabotage the voting process by stealing the ballots. Pratap starts his rampage by eliminating, one by one, every rival of his party. Eventually, he comes across a man named Babu Qadri, who seeks Pratap's help in avenging his sister's death. Bukka Reddy had raped his 16-year-old sister, because of which she immolated herself, and Bukka had then broken Babu Qadri's leg. Pratap assures him his vengeance but asks him to forget everything for some time.
As Bukka Reddy's men fail in rigging the election process, Pratap Ravi wins by a majority. Immediately, Bukka Reddy is arrested. Puru Reddy gets him out on bail through Sirji's influence. Bukka, inflamed with the desire to avenge his father's death, hides out in an apartment with his men, and plots to kill Pratap Ravi. Pratap learns about his hideout devises a plan to execute him. He immediately gathers his men and calls Babu Qadri, who had sought Pratap's help in avenging his sister, to lead the execution of Bukka Reddy. He calls for the servant of Bukka Reddy and bribes him with 500,000 to aid in the execution. Babu Qadri and Pratap's men rush into the apartment, killing all Bukka's men; then killing Bukka Reddy with an axe."
890,Rakta Charitra 2,"The first half-hour is a recap of part I, such as the events of how Pratap Ravi (Vivek Oberoi) takes revenge for the murder of his father and brother, as well as how he comes to power. When no one in Andhra has the courage to stand up against Ravi, a man comes into the light to seek revenge on Prathap. Yeturi Suryanarayana Reddy, a.k.a. Surya (Suriya) is seen waiting in the woods near the main road, waiting for Pratap Ravi and hurls a bomb at his convoy. Unfortunately for Surya, Pratap Ravi escapes the bomb blast. Pratap Ravi's henchmen attempt to kill Surya, but he manages to escape.
Surya informs his wife that he missed the chance of killing Pratap Ravi. Meanwhile, the media asks Pratap Ravi if this attempt is a Surya's revenge for the TV bomb placed in Surya's home by Pratap himself. Pratap Ravi denies the charge. Shivaji Rao asks Pratap to stop this vengeance, but Prathap insists on killing Surya. Pratap orders his action team to kill anyone who opposes him. DCP Mohan Prasad (Sudeepa) starts to investigate the case. He finds Bhavani (Priyamani), wife of Surya, and demands Surya to surrender or else he would harm his wife and baby son Arya. Surya thinks that he has missed a great chance and another chance will not come so easily and decides to surrender for protection plots to kill Prathap Ravi. DCP Mohan Prasad produces Surya in court to face trial. Prathap Ravi sends a henchmen to kill Surya in the court itself, but Surya manages to fight him and kills the henchman in front of the judge. Surya is sent to prison.
Pratap Ravi decides to kill Surya inside the jail, he plans carefully and decides someone from outside their camp should do this, so that the police does not suspect them. In prison, Surya befriends Muddu Krishna by telling him his story. The flashback shows that after Pratap Ravi's attempt to kill Narasimha Reddy (Kitty), Surya's brother wants to take revenge. Surya, on the other hand, doesn't want to take revenge straight away, and tells him to be patient and to leave the matter as it is, as he doesn't want to put his mother and sister in any danger. Within a few months, Surya's entire family is killed in the TV bomb blast. After hearing the story, Muddu Krishna decides to help Surya in killing Ravi. The henchmen in prison try to kill Surya, but Surya fights them back. After this failure, Pratap Ravi is warned by Shivaji Rao. As a result, Pratap Ravi decides that he wants to stop this revenge, and he meets Surya in jail. Ravi tells Surya to stop this bloodshed, to which Surya promptly replies, ""I'll surely stop – after killing you"". Prathap thinks he can't do anything because he is in jail, which makes him defenceless.
Enter Krishnaswamy, the opposition Party leader, who decides to meet Surya. He says that to kill Pratap Ravi, Surya has to become a bigger name in Anantapur than Pratap Ravi. Krishnaswamy requests Surya to ask his wife to stand in the election. Surya convinces Bhavani to stand for election. This makes Ravi to fear for his life and also for his ministerial post, consequently his henchmen want to eliminate Bhavani but Nandini (Radhika Apte) pleads with Pratap Ravi not to kill Bhavani, causing Ravi to abort the plan. However, one of Ravi's closest gang members, Umapati, is already on his way to kill Bhavani. Muddu Krishna kills Umapati and saves Bhavani. Krishnaswamy comes to the prison to thank Surya, and Surya thanks him in return.
A scared Pratap organises a meeting involving the leaders of all the districts in Andhra Pradesh. Knowing this, Surya plots to kill Pratap Ravi. He realises that in the meeting, all the leaders will participate with their bodyguards. He orders Muddu Krishna to dress like a bodyguard since no one would be able to identify whose bodyguard belongs to whoever. Using this ambiguity, Surya's henchmen can kill Pratap Ravi. After the meeting comes to an end, Pratap Ravi plans to leave. As he was leaving, he sees a familiar face and is struck. He sees Surya, standing in front of him with his handgun. Surya fires at Pratap Ravi until he dies in a pool of blood. Surya's friends put tear gas and create panic, and under the cover of smoke, Surya escapes from the scene and returns to the prison. Nandini cries by hugging her dead husband, Pratap Ravi.
Muddu Krishna takes the blame for killing Pratap Ravi for Surya. DCP Mohan Prasad comes to meet Surya in jail and justifies why Pratap Ravi became a factionist. It was the circumstances that made Pratap Ravi a factionist. He adds to Surya that the same circumstances will change him into a Ravi. Surya finally says, ""Thank you, but I won't change into another Ravi"". The movie ends with the birth of Pratap Ravi's child."

894,Rudhramadevi (film),"Ganapatideva (Krishnam Raju) is the emperor of the Kakatiya dynasty who rules the Kakatiya Empire from Orugallu (present day Warangal, Telangana) as its capital city. There are only two threats to Ganapati's rule. Murari Devudu (Adithya Menon) and Hari Hara Devudu (Suman), dukes of Kakatiya, are both obviously unsatisfied with Ganapati's reign, and plot to usurp the throne. Emperor Singhana of the Devagiri Empire also wishes to conquer the Kakatiyas and name his grandson and heir, Mahadeva, as the king. Meanwhile, Ganapati's wife is pregnant. Everyone prays for a boy child, because a prince can repel the Devagiri Empire and serve as a successor to the throne. A priest working for Murari and Hari Hara predicts Ganapati's baby will be a girl who will be the saviour of the kingdom.
Ganapati's baby indeed turns out to be a girl, Rudramadevi (Anushka Shetty). Her birth disappoints Ganapati, who, being helpless, takes advice from his prime minister, Siva Devayya (Prakash Raj), to announce the baby to be a boy – Rudrama. Murari and Hari Hara go mad after hearing the news that Ganapati gets a prince, a successor to be of the crown; they then angrily kill the priest who predicted Rudrama would be a girl before ""his"" birth. Rudrama's gender and real name are kept secret from everyone other than Ganapati, his wife, and Siva Devayya; even Rudramadevi herself does not know she's a girl in her childhood.
Rudrama is then brought up and trained in a prince's manner. After a few years of training, Rudrama is summoned back to Oragallu for her coronation as the crown prince. At her coronation, she befriends Chalukya Veerabhadra (Rana Daggubati), a neighborhing prince, and forms a friendly rivalry with Gona Ganna Reddy (Allu Arjun), another neighboring prince. She sneaks out of the capital along with Chalukya to bathe in the river. She realizes her gender when she sees an elegant statue of a beautiful woman. After seeing the boys disrobe, she realizes that her body is different from theirs. She then runs to her mother angrily and confusedly to ask the reason for hiding her real gender; her mother confesses the story and tells her the reason was to protect the kingdom. In front of her parents and Siva Devayya, Rudrama swears to continue living as a boy until the kingdom's safety is assured.
Years later, in a sporting event, Naga Devudu, the nephew of Murari and Hari Hara, fails to subdue a raging elephant. Murari and Hari Hara challenge Rudrama to defeat the elephant. Rudrama accepts, however she is unaware that Murari and Hari Hara have rigged the competition so no one can win. Despite this, Rudrama wins the challenge, making her adored by several princesses in the scene, including Muktamba (Nithya Menen). Gona Ganna Reddy, one of Rudrama's playmates in childhood and who was then thrown out of the palace and is now called a traitor, shows up in the scene to confront Rudrama. Gona is now the leader of an opposition army, which has been a threat to Ganapati's position. He manages to escape when Ganapati's army tries to arrest him.
Ganapati, unable to escape from the pressure from inside and outside his palace, decides to get Rudrama married to a princess, and he chooses Muktamba. On their wedding night, Rudrama, in order to protect her secret, tells Muktamba that she has taken a vow of celibacy until the kingdom is safe. The conversation is tapped by a spy of Murari and Hari Hara, and she tells it to the two, making the secret and the fame of the Ganapati's family in danger.
The two plan to reveal the secret and use it as an excuse to force Ganapati off the throne. However, before they can do so, Siva Devayya decides to reveal the secret to the people.
Siva Devayya then announces Rudramadevi's real identity and her to be the queen of the kingdom. The people of Kakatiya, after knowing Ganapati has cheated them for many years, become angry and unsatisfied and strongly object. Rudramadevi is not accepted by the people to be their queen and is hence driven out of the kingdom. Ganapati also loses the trust and support of his people because of this. Murari and Hari Hara take this chance to launch a coup using the secret passageway. They then proclaim that they will rule Oragallu in Mahadeva's name, while maintaining their own power. Before Murari and Hari Hara can kill Siva Devayya, he has a heart attack and dies.
It doesn't take too long for the people to realize that who deserves to rule the kingdom, as Murari and Hari Hara start to prosecute them with higher tax rates and unprecedented cruelty and aristocracy soon after they take power. The desperate people, along with Siva Devayya (who faked his death), then turn to Rudramadevi to apologize and for help. Rudramadevi then forms these people as an opposition army to fight against her own kingdom's army.
Rudramadevi and her army meet Gona Ganna Reddy's army on her way, which is surprisingly not about to attack her, but to help her get her crown back. It is revealed that Gona, who noticed Rudramadevi was a girl in their childhood, is not a traitor but a most loyal warrior of the kingdom. He had already expected that Rudramadevi would lose her power and be driven out of the kingdom one day, so he left the palace, pretending to be driven out for being a traitor, to form his own army to wait for the day.
After they join hands, their united army is greater and stronger than that of Murari and Hari Hara and beats the latter. They also repel and defeat the Devagiri Empire. Rudramadevi then gets her crown back, marries Chalukya, and becomes the first queen in South Indian history."

Vitthal had studied Vedas and set out on pilgrimages at a young age. In Alandi, about 30 km from Pune, Sidhopant, a local Yajurveda Brahmin was very much impressed with him and Vitthal married his daughter Rukmini.
After some time, getting permission from Rukmini, Vitthal went to Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, India, where he met Ramananda Swami and requested to be initiated into sannyas, lying about his marriage. But Ramananda Swami later went to Alandi and, convinced that his student Vitthal was the husband of Rukmini, he returned to Kashi and ordered Vitthal to return home to his family. The couple was excommunicated from the Brahmin caste as Vitthal had broken with sannyas, the last of the four ashrams. Four children were born to them; Nivrutti, Jñāndev, Sopan, Mukta. It is believed that later Vitthal and Rukmini ended their lives by jumping into the waters at Prayag where the river Ganges meets Yamuna, hoping that their children would be accepted into the society after their death.
The orphaned children grew up on alms. They approached the Brahmin community of Paithan to accept them, but the Brahmins refused. According to the disputed ""Shuddhi Patra"", the children were purified by the Brahmins on the condition of observing celibacy. But when they returned, the Brahmins did not pay any attention to the Shuddhi Patra and said that it was fake.

Salomalo then informs the Mughals, Shivaji's enemies that the king was in town, but God protects Shivaji at behest of Tukaram, when the Mughals come to Dehu. His saintliness brought hordes of people from different regions of the state offering worship at his feet and also offering him huge gifts which could enrich him but he refuses to accept any kind of rewards. When Tukaram's work is done on earth, God comes to take him to heaven. Tukaram asks his wife to join, but she refuses as she has to look after the children.The film also depicts various miracles of Tukaram like God visiting him, an army being created from Vithoba's image, showering of grains from the sky, curing a sick boy, retrieving his works from the river which was intentionally thrown there, and in the end, going to the heaven in a celestial chariot."

After the marriage, Tanisha, the emperor of Golconda, with the recommendation of Akkanna and Madanna (the uncles of Gopanna), appoints Gopanna as Tehsildar of Husnabad. Thus, a Muslim who had been the Tehsildar of the place is dethroned for the sake of Gopanna. That ignites disgust among a few groups who attempt to murder Gopanna. However, Dammakka saves him while he lies unconscious on the bank of Godavari. She shows him the place of Bhadragiri and Gopanna becomes an ardent devotee of Rama.

Exasperated, Tanisha imprisons Ramadasu. After many ordeals faced by Ramadasu in prison, Lord Rama, and Lakshmana appear to Tanisha in a dream and pay the required amount to him. Then Tanisha releases Ramadasu from prison and discovers that the two who cleared the debt were Lord Rama and Lakshmana. After being released from prison, Ramadasu is frustrated that he never obtained a darshanam (appearance/glimpse) of Rama. He realizes that Rama is in his heart and cuts open his chest. Sri Rama and Sitamma appear from his heart and heal his wounds. Rama offers Gopanna the chance to go to Vaikunta as a living man, a boon granted to few. When Gopanna asks what is there in Vaikunta (The Highest Heaven), Rama says there is only happiness and no need to pray. However, Gopanna can only find happiness in saying Rama's name. As the only man ever to refuse Vaikuntha, Rama grants his wish: Ramadasu's spirit will remain forever in the Bhadrachalam Temple.

Presently, Veerabrahmam affirms to take salvation Sajeeva Samadhi i.e., buried alive.

Akbar sends a few of his workers to the countryside to find  the best musician. While his workers are searching, they come across Tansen, who while singing for Tani brings a leafless tree to bloom. The workers are overwhelmed at this and ask Tansen to go to the court of Akbar along with them. Tansen refuses at first by saying that he will sing for no one other than his sweetheart Tani. After repeated persuasions, he finally agrees to go to Agra where he enthralls Akbar by his singing. Akbar appoints him as one of his navratnas. The other musicians in the royal court see this move as a threat to their reputation and status in the court.
On Akbar's birthday, Tani goes to Agra to meet Tansen and in order to meet her, Tansen refuses to sing on the king's birthday. Upon meeting Tani, Akbar tells her that Tansen is married and asks her to leave. He does so thinking that a broken heart will inspire even better music from Tansen. When Akbar later asks Tansen to sing, he refuses to do so saying that he would accept even the death penalty, but would not sing. One of the court musicians, Zehen Khan tells Akbar and his sick princess that the Deepak raag has the magic of igniting things. Akbar asks Tansen to sing the Deepak raag, but again he refuses. Finally, on repeated persuasions by the sick princess, Tansen agrees to sing. Tansen ignites the candles placed near him when he is singing. He continues singing in extreme heat and gets badly burnt. When Akbar learns from Azam Khan (the court physician) that Zehen Khan and the other court musicians were plotting against Tansen, he orders the arrest of them all. Meanwhile, Tansen's condition worsens. Birbal, the court philosopher suggests to Akbar that a singer who can sing the Malhar raag (known for bringing heavy rain) should be searched for. Akbar himself searches for such a singer, but is unable to find one. The dying Tansen wishes to meet his friend Raja Ramchandra. Along the way to his village Tansen meets Tani near a fountain and she heals him by singing the Megh Malhar raag."

To earn a living, he migrates to Hampi with his wife Kamala and son Madhava. On his way to Hampi, he stops at a Kali temple. He is initially terrified looking at the goddess' idol and the animal sacrifices made to please her. That night, Kali appears before him and grants a boon: he must choose either wisdom or wealth. Ramakrishna opts for both, which angers Kali. She warns him that he might end up as a Vikatakavi (clownish poet) whose wisdom is useful solely for entertaining others. Ramakrishna accepts this as a blessing and asks Kali to save him from further dangers. The goddess agrees and disappears.
Ramakrishna reaches Hampi and approaches Tatacharya, the royal priest of the Vijayanagara Empire, to find employment in the court of King Krishnadevaraya. Neither Tatacharya nor his assistants help him, and he leaves dejected.

Ramakrishna solves the problem and Krishnadevaraya appoints him as a member of the court. With his wit and loyalty, Ramakrishna soon earns the respect of all the court's members except for Tatacharya who sees him as a problem.

Worried about the state of affairs, Ramakrishna ignores the King's order and enters his abode dressed as a woman, but he is ignored and expelled from the kingdom.
Meanwhile, Krishnadevaraya's wife Tirumala Devi falls seriously ill, and he finally realizes his mistakes. Once the King is back at his palace, Ramakrishna manages to enter Krishnasani's chamber again, this time under the guise of a saint. He catches her red-handed with her gang of spies, and signals to the hidden soldiers to surround her. She kills herself preferring a dignified death.

932,Aranyer Din Ratri,"The plot of the movie goes back to a similar outing the writer Sunil Gangopadhyay took in the early days of his poetic career. The story unfolds around a group of four friends, who despite their differences, bonded deeply. The four friends are all educated and come from different layers of society, but the urge to escape from the daily grind of city life forces them to wander in tribal lands.
Of the four friends, Asim, the leader of the pack, owns the car they drive in, has a cushy job, likes the company of girls and yet is very conscious of how he should be perceived by them. Sanjoy is a labour executive but would ideally want to immerse himself in literature.  Hari, a frank and straightforward cricketer, wants to forget the girl who dumped him. Shekhar is the jester, the only one without a job. He has a roving eye but stays sober when his friends get drunk and vent their frustrations.
They set out for the tribal Palamau, in Bihar. They had read legends about this land, the tribal women who are open, simple and beautiful.  Wanting to break rules, they forcefully stay at a forest rest house by bribing the chowkidar. The stay symbolizes their distance from city life and civilization: they wonder whether to shave or not. Hari gets close to tribal Santhal girl Duli when she approaches the group for extra drink.
Their resolve to be unshaven collapses when Shekhar sees two ladies Aparna and her sister-in-law Jaya in the forest. They introduce themselves to their family. The two urban groups of people are almost relieved to find each other here. Asim flirts with Aparna and coaxes her to show her room. He is attracted to the elegant and enigmatic Aparna, but is unable to keep pace with her composure, presence of mind and intelligence. At night the four friends go to drink alcohol again in the country liquor house. Hari is upset because he cannot see Duli whom he had met previous night. While returning to their rest house, they stumble upon a car which they shout at without realising it is that of Aparna and Jaya. They oversleep and miss the next day's breakfast at Jaya's place. They find a tiffin outside their rooms and go to Aparna's house to return it. Later, the conservator visits the forest rest house and catches them staying at the Forest Bungalow without permission. When they are about to be kicked out, Aparna, the conservator's acquaintance, manages the situation with her natural grace and composure. The group decides to chat and play a game while Aparna's father is away with Jaya's son. The game reaches a crescendo, with only Asim and Aparna left in the fray, at which point Aparna pulls out, deliberately handing victory to Asim, who seems to have placed his entire confidence at stake on the win.
The tensions peak at the village fair where the four friends go their own way. Shekhar goes off to gamble with money borrowed from Asim. Hari takes Duli into the forest and has sex with her.

On the other hand, Bulbul confesses that she wants to be a supermodel and advises Karan that he does not need a large amount of money to start a business, but a big ""idea"". Back in India, Sajjan has a heart attack. Karan's mother Maya pawns her jewelry in order to arrange some amount of money for better facilities and an AC room at the hospital as his insurance could only afford a Non-AC room. This leaves Karan heart-broken, and he immediately decides to get rich by any means, he decides to start his own venture along with his friends.

For this, they have to separate the consignment into two-halves, one half with only left shoes in Calcutta and the other half with only right shoes in Madras. At both places, the buyer will refuse to receive the consignment, hence the entire consignment will be confiscated. The confiscated consignment will then be auctioned in which Chandu (in Calcutta) and Karan (in Madras) will buy the entire consignment, pretending they are scrap dealers. Once the right shoes pair up with left shoes, the zero-valued product comes into a full value which can be sold at any profit without any customs charges. They name their venture ""Friends and Company"" and proceed to make a large fortune with it. When Karan is caught red-handed by Sajjan while putting away the black money, he explains the situation, including the fact that he is doing business with a smuggler. As a result, he is forced to leave the house and starts living with Bulbul and uses her to get contracts. After the government in India decides to reduce the import duty on foreign goods (including shoes), the friends decide to go to America. They get help from Karan's Uncle Jazz.

However, Karan becomes too greedy and the group begins to fall apart. Zing and Chandu get into a fight after Zing hits Linda. Karan and Zing get into an argument about Zing's excessive drinking. Zing leaves and opens his own bar. Bulbul leaves when she finds out that Karan has married another woman for a green card. Chandu weds Linda and quits the company to start a video store with her.

The buyers order a trial order of 5,000 pieces. Linda, who is one of Michael Jackson’s backstage dancers, promotes their shirt that he wears in one of his concerts. The public goes crazy over this new shirt, due to which Karan receives another order, this time for a much larger number of shirts.

Throughout the movie, they have added their childhood clips and narrated what had happened in their school life.
The whole movie is divided into five parts 1. ""Perilatha Gang""   2. ""Neechanum mlechanum""   3. ""Plastic Nirodhikanam""   4. ""Cheruthoniyile Bhagath Singh""   5. ""Idukki Gold"". The movie focuses on their teenage and their current life. Ravi being an easygoing guy became a photographer after graduation with very few clients. Madan had a successful life becoming a planter but was forced to divorce his wife Shyamala as they had no children and was very unhappy. The crew finally finds Antony living a normal quiet life as a restaurant manager. Antony decides to join the trip. They continue their journey to pick up their final member Raman who used to be a core communist. After few hardships they find Raman but in a baffled situation. Raman being a widower with a single son falls in love with one of his co workers Manju but he learns that her marriage is already fixed. On the night of her marriage Raman and Manju elope together with the help of his son and old friends who happened to pass by to pick him up. His friends arrange the marriage and Raman joins the road trip. The flashbacks tells us how the boys used to get drunk, smoke up marijuana and ""beedi"" and had fun bunking classes and just chilling with their friends.
The title of the movie was obtained from the actual Marijuana known as ""Idukki Gold"" , which these boys had smoked up as teens. They go in search for this so prominent ""Idukki Gold "" and the movie takes on to a serious note when they are met with an accident and find themselves in a field of Marijuana. But they find out that they are held captive by Behnnan whom these boys had a fight with as kids. Behnnan was a helper boy at an estate near their school. The boys were caught by the Principal for smoking and they thought Behnnan was the one who sold them out. They beat up Behnnan and leave him there half dead. There they are scared that Behnnan will shoot them for blinding him in one of his eye but the plot twists when Behnnan just smiles at them and tells them all he ever wanted to was to be friends with them. The movie ends on a cheerful note as Behnnan sets them free and Madan reunites with Shyamala the crew realizing that it was the friendship who bound them together not the ""Idukki Gold""."
958,Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na,"The story begins as four friends travel with a guest to an airport, when Jignesh ""Jiggy"" Patel, Ravindran ""Rotlu"" Sahu, Sandhya ""Bombs"" Sahay and Shaleen Varma offer to tell Jiggy's date, air hostess Mala Mishra, the unique love story of Jai and Aditi, two friends who they have known.  Jai ""Ratz"" Singh Rathore is the most non-violent Rajput to have ever existed, while Aditi ""Meow"" Mahant is an aggressive and impulsive girl. Her nickname is the result of her abuse and scratching of people.
Despite their differences, Jai and Aditi are best friends in college. They seem perfectly meant for each other, a fact acknowledged by everyone except the two themselves. Aditi often has a bickering relationship with her brother Amit, who seems to hate Jai because of his polite and cool nature, and since Aditi cannot stand any insults against Jai, she regularly picks up fights with him. Aditi dreams of a virile, macho husband, while Jai wants a sweet, romantic girl. Since they do not believe that they are in love, they search for a perfect life partner for each other after finishing college. Jai falls in love with Meghna Pariyar after spotting her in a club where two rough men were misbehaving with her. He rescues her by tricking the duo, thus winning Meghna's heart. When Meghna and Jai get close to each other, Rotlu, Jiggy, Sandhya, and Shaleen are happy for Jai, but nobody notices that Aditi is missing Jai's company. Meghna informs Jai that her parents squabble but cannot live without each other. Jai visits Meghna's parents and sees that her father, Mahesh, is an alcoholic who has much friction with his ex-wife Sheela. Due to the meeting, he misses Aditi's surprise birthday party. Realizing that he missed the occasion, he goes late at night to wish her but is sent back after a conversation between the two culminates in Aditi asking him to leave.
Feeling deserted, Aditi gets engaged to her father's friend's son, Sushant Modi. She sees in him the macho man she always wanted. However, Sushant is also a spoilt playboy whose ex-girlfriend, Richa, has landed him in trouble twice. Amit, upon having a word with Sushant in person, tries to make her see Sushant for who he really is but Aditi continues her relationship, considering that Jai is still with Meghna. At Jiggy's birthday party, where Jai and Meghna are also present, Aditi introduces Sushant to everyone. Both Jai and Aditi are upset with each other's relationship. During a romantic dance, Sushant finds that Aditi is crying and kisses her, which upsets Jai further.
Meghna tries to cheer him up, but Jai becomes angrier, shouting at her and chiding her for being ignorant of the friction between her parents. She breaks down and tells him about her parents' divorce due to Mahesh's extramarital affair which affected her psychologically, leading her to imagine a perfect world and be childish so as to not be burdened with the reality of being a forced thread between her parents. The next day, Jai breaks up with Meghna whereby she is shattered to learn that he loves Aditi and leaves with a goodbye kiss. As for Aditi, she is under duress from Sushant, who, after realizing she loves Jai, slaps her on her face, leaving a bruise. She decides to break the engagement and go to New York to study alone, while actually wanting to return to Jai. When she meets Jai, he spots the bruise on Aditi's face, and contrary to his usual non-violent nature, goes to Sushant's house and beats him up for daring to lay a hand on Aditi.
Inspector P.K. Waghmare, who is at odds with Jai's mother Savitri Singh Rathore, arrests Jai for thrashing Sushant and puts him behind bars. Later that night, while still in prison, he meets the two men who were found harassing Meghna at the club and is surprised to see them celebrating their imprisonment. They tell him that for a boy to become a man in their clan, he must complete three conditions: 
1) thrash someone 
2) get arrested 
3) ride a horse. 
As they narrate to Jai the story of their adventures in Mumbai and mention that it wouldn't have been possible for them to fulfill these conditions in Ranjhor, he inadvertently reveals his credentials as a native of Ranjhor, which causes the two men, seemingly brothers to each other, to sit up and decipher his identity. Once he mentions that he is the son of the late Amar Singh Rathore and the two men confirm that his mother's name is Savitri, they clutch him to the ground in joy, and he discovers in an epiphany when they address him as ""Mowgli"" that the brothers are his long-lost cousins, Kuber ""Baloo"" Singh Rathore and Vinay ""Bagheere"" Singh Rathore, from whom he had been separated in childhood. Jai, who has already fulfilled the first two conditions required for becoming a man in the Rathore clan, finally comes to terms with his legacy, realizing that Amar was actually never the non-violent type Savitri had painted him as and that she was lying to him all along. 
Meanwhile, Aditi makes her way to the international airport to depart for New York. Baloo and Bagheere, who are sons of Amar's cousin, now an MLA, use their influence to bail Jai out, after which Jai rides to the airport on a borrowed horse to stop Aditi from leaving. This makes him fulfill the final condition, and an initially worried Savitri, after spotting him, decides to return home, dejected that Amar's dream has come true. Jai finds Aditi at the airport lounge and sings her the titular song which he had confessed earlier as the one he would sing for the love of his life. Aditi, delighted, hugs him and cancels her travel plans. Back in the present, Rotlu, Jiggy, Sandhya, and Shaleen conclude the story and welcome Jai and Aditi, who return from their honeymoon after 5 years, at the airport. Mala gets extremely delighted to see them and introduces herself as Jiggy's girlfriend, and they leave the airport together."

962,Kannedhirey Thondrinal,"Vasanth is the son of a prominent industrialist in Coimbatore. He enrolls in an engineering college in Chennai, where he butts heads with Shankar, a short-tempered and somewhat violent senior. Their animosity persists, but after Vasanth helps Shankar fight off a bunch of ruffians, they become best friends. Vasanth proves to be a calming influence on Shankar, who is impressed by Vasanth's humility, in spite of his vast wealth.
Shankar's family is something of a puzzle to Vasanth: upon receiving an invite to Shankar's house, Vasanth overhears Shankar's mother asking him why he invited visitors over. The cold reception upsets Vasanth, who makes up an excuse to leave to an embarrassed Shankar. In due course, Shankar's mother understands Vasanth's good nature and becomes very affectionate towards him.
In a side story, Vasanth chances upon a girl in the Coimbatore railway station one day. Smitten, he chases her and while she seems disinterested, he persists in his affections, eventually landing up in jail for eve-teasing after a misunderstanding with the police relating to their relationship, which she doesn't attempt to clear. The twist - the girl is revealed to be Priya, Shankar's younger sister, who in the face of Vasanth's decency upon his release - he doesn't reveal anything about her role in his imprisonment to Shankar or his mother, and withdraws from her life - discovers that she loves him too. They make up, but before they announce their love to their families, Shankar tells Vasanth about an act of treachery committed by one of his closest friends against his family.
The flashback is revealed. Shankar's family has one more member not mentioned thus far - another sister Shanthi. There are happy scenes where Shankar, his friends and his mother prepare for her wedding. Of his friends, there is a particularly close one - Shakthi, who much like Vasanth today was Shankar's best friend at the time. Tragedy strikes when Shankar and his mother find that his sister had fled from the wedding hall, and they try to find her, encountering several humiliations along the way - from the groom's family and the police. Finally, they see an auto rickshaw, where his sister emerges from, and to his shock, Shakthi is with her. It turns out Shanthi had run off to marry Shakthi, which leaves Shankar and his mother broken-hearted. In their hurt and rage, they disown Shanthi, and become much more guarded with their interactions with Shankar's friends, explaining Shankar's mother's initial reaction towards Vasanth.

Priya, on the other hand, is unwilling to let go, and requests him on repeated occasions to accept her love, to no avail. Her family prepares to arrange for her wedding, and increasingly desperate, she consumes poison and is taken to the hospital. Vasanth's friend Boopalan, who believes enough is enough, tells Shankar and his family about Vasanth and Priya's love for each other, and how Vasanth, for the sake of his friendship with Shankar, had sacrificed his love.

To a bewildered Ajay and Nisha, the stranger reveals that he is Charlie, an undercover police officer working on the murder cases. He tells that he suspected Vikram and Sherie of running the extortion racket much before the first murder. He already knew about the prank, but was unsure of the killer's identity. So he stole their typewriter. Then Cobra killed Vikram and Sherie to keep his secret intact. Then he knew that Cobra is behind all this and used the duo to track down Cobra. He reassures Ajay and Nisha that even though Black Cobra destroyed all the proof, there is no proof against the duo either. He tells the duo to collect the typewriter from him the next day. The duo oblige, vowing never to play such pranks again."

984,Ninaithale Inikkum (2009 film),"Shiva (Prithviraj) is an energetic, enthusiastic college student. Being short-tempered, he gets easily provoked by the rich, proud Vasu (Karthik Kumar) and his sneering attitude. From glares and snarls to punches and fights, Vasu and Shiva do it all, even for unreasonable, petty things. Shakthi (Shakthi Vasu) stops their quarrels before they injure each other very badly. As he is friendly, kindhearted, and cool-headed, Shakthi tries to bring Shiva and Vasu together on friendly terms, but in vain. Shiva, Shakthi, and their faithful friend Bala (Vishnu Priyan) stay together through thick and thin and are always ready to voice out their views on behalf of those who stay in the hostel in the college. Shakthi’s father (Bhagyaraj) often visits his son in the hostel and is like a father to all of Shakthi’s friends. Meera (Priyamani), the daughter of an MLA, nurtures a soft corner for Shiva. She is brave enough to stand up to him and check him when he throws unnecessary tantrums. Shalini (Anuja Iyer), Meera’s friend, is a shy, reserved Muslim girl from a very strict family background. She is often preoccupied with her own thoughts. Karthik (Lollu Sabha Jeeva) is a total showoff who tries to humiliate Shiva and Shakthi but ends up making a fool of himself.
The movie begins on an aeroplane as Shiva (a mature-looking Prithviraj, with a French beard and rimless spectacles) heads back to his college to meet his friends. With his eyes sparkling with nostalgic memories, he takes a trip down memory lane, and what he recalls about his college days forms the main part of the story.

Shiva remains the most melancholic of them all. All goes well until Shiva is found almost strangled to death. Everyone suspects Vasu, but Shakthi's father discovers that the murder was attempted by Shalini.
In a flashback, it is revealed that Shakthi and Shalini were lovers. In an ultimate twist, Shalini reveals that Shiva, who was running away from the police after breaking into an election booth, killed Shakthi with chloroform as the latter suffered from asthma. Shalini is upset that Shakthi's father prevented her from taking revenge against Shiva.
Shiva is cured and comes to seek an apology from Shakthi's father for accidentally killing Shakthi. Shakthi's father forgives Shiva and asks him to marry Meera, who has been waiting for him for over eight years. Vasu also comes to seek an apology from Shiva for all of his antics in college. Shakthi's parents adopt Shalini, whose family has died, and decide to take her home. The film ends as Shalini says farewell to her friends and to the image of Shakthi, who is forever present on the college campus.
The message of the film goes for all of us: ""Never forget the sweet memories that happened in college."""

Magik members find the song really good and suggest Jiah sing in an upcoming concert.

Adi learns of some problems in the town in Meghalaya where he had been living, and this causes a rift between him and Sakshi, who is upset that he does not have time for her. Adi lands at the airport, where he encounters Jiah again, but, they are unable to get over Rahul's death. Finally, after some hard thinking, Jiah visits Adi in the village and convinces him to stop brooding over Rahul's suicide, stating that he was so dejected with life that he ended up messing with Adi's life as well. Adi visits the camp, but, there are not much funding available, so Joe and KD come up with the idea of organizing a rock concert with some known bands to raise collective funds. However, as soon as Mahender, the state welfare board chief, who had earlier gotten into an egoistic argument with Adi, learns of this, he orders an ambush on the concert venue, thus ruining everything.
That very day, Panditji is called by a news reporter and is surprised to learn that Jiah is at the venue of the attack. During an angry conversation, Jiah vents out to Baba that it was he who had killed Rahul by not motivating him what he needed badly in life. Panditji breaks down, and drops the phone.

Later, when filming the music video, the band are forced to wear clothes they do not like, and the cameramen focus only on Aditya.

He later scolds Sakshi for trying to dig up his past, which he claims to have left behind. Sakshi is hurt, and she leaves him after informing him that she is pregnant. Devika persuades Aditya to face his past and meet with his ex-bandmates. KD, Joe, and Rob meet up and visit the place where they used to practice as a band. Aditya also arrives and reconciles with Joe and the rest. They start practicing regularly at Aditya's house. Learning about this, Sakshi, too, returns to Aditya.

1009,Kaththi,"In Kolkata, Kathiresan is a prisoner, who helps the police capture an escaping prisoner Vivek Banerjee but escapes afterwards.
Kathiresan goes to Chennai to escape to Bangkok with his friend Ravi. However, he drops this plan after meeting and falling in love with Ankitha, who dupes him into believing that she wants to marry him after realising that he is having a crush on her and gives him a false phone number. Later, Kathir and Ravi notice Jeevanandham, who resembles Kathir, being shot by a group of thugs. They admit him to a hospital, and Kathir decides to impersonate the injured Jeeva to escape from the police. Under Jeeva's name, Kathir and Ravi enter an old-age home run by Jeeva with the intention of stealing ₹25 lakh (US$31,000) from there for their Bangkok trip, until Kathir learns about Jeeva's mission.
Jeeva is a communist ideologue and post-graduate in hydrology from the arid village of Thanoothu in Tirunelveli district who had discovered groundwater under some lands of the village which could be used as an irrigation source not only for the village, but for the entire Tirunelveli district and the neighbouring Thoothukudi district. However, a greedy entrepreneur named Chirag cheated the villagers into giving their lands for the construction of a factory. Jeeva got arrested, and six villagers committed suicide to bring this news to the media forefront and get Jeeva released. Moved, Kathir decides to fight for the villagers' cause while still posing as Jeeva. The people of the old home and Kathir go to the jury and try to convince him to go in favour of them, but Kathir starts stating rules and scares the main jury person (whom Chirag had bribed).
Kathir then sends a person (disguised as a hairdresser) to Chirag and makes him lay a fingerprint on Chirag's neck. After that, Chirag sends 50 men to kill Kathir, but he defeats them. Meanwhile, Jeeva finds himself in the Kolkata prison. With the help of Vivek, who has heard his story and plans to kill Kathir, he escapes with Vivek's henchmen. Unaware that Jeeva is headed for Chennai with Vivek's henchmen, Kathir makes efforts to convince the media to bring the plight of the villagers to national consciousness, but the media is uninterested as they feel it is not a sensational news. A few days later, at the Madras High Court, the judge declares the verdict in favour of Jeeva and the villagers, but adds that Chirag has claimed that certain villagers working abroad have shown their support for the factory. If they cannot prove that their support was faked by Chirag within the next five days, the verdict will go in Chirag's favour.
Since the villagers who have denied supporting the factory are abroad and cannot come to Chennai so soon to rebut Chirag's claims as their passports are held by their contractors, Kathir decides on drastic measures to sensationalise the issue.

1012,Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year,"Harpreet Singh Bedi (Ranbir Kapoor), a B. Com. graduate with approximately 39 percent marks, becomes a salesman with a big corporate computer assembly and service company, AYS, headed by MD Sunil Puri (Manish Chaudhari). Despite initial objections from sales head Nitin Rathore, Harpreet is taken in by Puri, and begins learning the tricks of the sales trade from Nitin. He is shown to live alone with his widowered grandfather P.S. Bedi (Prem Chopra), and a circle that comprises his best friends Sai Ram (Amol Parashar), the lawyer son of an IAS officer who wants Harpreet to pursue an MBA, and Aparna ""Appy"" Singh (Debi Dutta), a designer. Later, he is sent to his first major field visit, where manager S.P. Chaudhary (Rajesh Jais) asks for a kick-back. Disgruntled due to his honest nature, he drops a letter in the complaint box nearby, accusing Chaudhary. However, when Nitin and Puri strongly condemn his actions and threaten to fire him as Chaudhary is a huge client, he feels humiliated and is isolated by the other salespersons, who are enraged after their targets are raised due to Harpreet's actions; they throw paper airplanes onto him as an insult.
Harpreet is unable to do anything, but after the appointment of a new senior manager, is able to take software operator Girish ""Giri"" Reddy (D. Santosh) and receptionist Koena Shaikh (Gauahar Khan) into confidence. Koena gives him the lead to a customer, Sherena Khanna (Shazahn Padamsee), who lives within his previously assigned ""sales zone"". A fashion entrepreneur living with her colleague Ayesha, she is initially disappointed by Harpreet's pitch, but calms him down, and he agrees to help her. Quite soon, he realizes that sales success depends on customer satisfaction, meaning that bribery will not be necessary to secure contracts. After making concessions to Sherena, he decides to found a new enterprise, Rocket Sales Corporation, from within AYS, naming it after the paper airplanes thrown at him. With this, he decides to make Giri and Koena partners in the venture.
Rocket Sales Corporation is being managed from within the AYS offices, with Giri later revealing that the tea-server, Chotelal Mishra, has a knack for assembling computer parts; they decide to make him an equal partner too. Usually working at night, they are later discovered by Nitin, who is rather reluctantly admitted into the venture and becomes a partner; in the process, he gradually abandons some of the typical AYS tricks he usually played, including bribes. Meanwhile, with Puri's humiliation of him in Chaudhary's presence still fresh in his mind, Harpreet decides to lock horns with Puri, seeking to avenge his humiliation.
The five-member company targets previous clients of AYS, who were irritated with AYS's attitude, and soon enjoys a strong client reputation. The company soon becomes successful because of its dedication to excellent customer service. Although it does not make much profit, Rocket Sales Corporations is able to make a huge difference. AYS's sales start decreasing as many of the clients cancel their orders and place orders at Rocket Sales, which offers them better services. Harpreet starts a relationship with Sherena in the process.
Enraged over this success, as he coaxes Nitin to discover the truth in exchange for a promotion to the post of Vice-President, Puri moves quickly to attempt to contact the MD of Rocket Sales Corporation and in a phone conversation attempts to entice him to sell Rocket Sales Corporation to AYS, little realizing it is Harpreet, who not only rejects Puri's offer but claims that Rocket Sales Corporation will buy AYS Computers. Afraid of Puri's attempts, Harpreet's partners have a discussion and move their headquarters to Sherena's house, making her a partner in the process. After multiple failed attempts in locating the Rocket Sales Corporation office, Puri decides to call the number on Rocket Sales Corporation's brochures and the phone at the AYS reception desk begins to ring. Realizing the truth when he sees Giri picking up, he walks in on the team. 
After thoroughly insulting him and firing both him and his partners, Puri has Harpreet sign a contract handing over Rocket Sales to him for a final compensation of Re. 1. Despite the elimination of potential competition from Harpreet, who is in return barred from conducting any computer assembly and service business, however, AYS is unable to maintain Rocket Sales' commitment to customer satisfaction because of its cold and greedy personnel. Seeing his downfall in purchasing Rocket Sales, Puri visits Harpreet at his new job at Croma, an electronics store, and returns the contract to Harpreet in return for Re. 1. He also tells him never to become a businessman again, because he will fail again. However, this is not intended as an insult, but rather as a compliment; he implies that what made Harpreet so successful was his eschewing of 'normal' business practices such as kickbacks, false advertisement, and low wages.
As the story ends, it shows an interviewee visiting the Rocket Sales Corporation office building. The firm is implied to be very successful, with P.S. Bedi joining in as the accounts manager; it shows the former AYS employees, all partners of the business, and finally closes with Harpreet smiling genially at a desk, showing that in the long run, honesty and hard work are sound business practices."

1015,Yevade Subramanyam,"Subramanyam ""Subbu"" is a materialistic IIM graduate who is very ambitious. He works for Pasupathi, who aims to buy his rival Ramaiah's company but fails at it. Subbu, with his wit and ability to manipulate people, makes Ramaiah's employees sell their shares. With this being Pasupathi's biggest success, Subbu gets engaged to his boss's daughter Rhea. During the engagement ceremony, a childhood friend, Rishi, enters his life. Rishi is very energetic and opposite in the character to Subbu. Rishi believes living every moment of the life to its fullest. He is a true artist of life, who lives and never thinks about living. The same day they encounter a free-spirited girl Anandi in a pub. Rishi reveals his dream is to travel with Subbu to Doodh Kasi, a holy lake in the Himalayas.
Rhea, Subbu and everyone in Pasupathi's reign think that they have conquered Ramaiah's company but they are shocked when they lose some shares, threatening Pasupathi's buy-out of Ramaiah's company. This enrages Pasupathi who threatens to fire Subbu and break his engagement to his daughter. Subbu promises Pasupathi that he will win, and goes to Ramaiah asking him to sell his company. Ramaiah rejects his offer humbly. Subbu feels low, and Rishi mentions Doodh Kasi. Rishi is amused when he finds out that a shareholder's value has upset Subbu. Rishi has Subbu promise about a trip to Doodh Kasi in exchange for returning the shareholder's details. They go to the person who owns the shares and find out that he is Anandi's father and that her signature can make Subbu win. Subbu and Rishi learn that Anandi is a very lonely girl, who has no family or friends. They befriend her. She keeps postponing signing over the ""shares"" to Subbu even though it is foremost on Subbu's mind, who always looks to make Anandi sign on the shares. On the way to meet Rhea, Rishi and Subbu see a little girl injured on the road and take her to the hospital. Late by a few minutes (i.e., ten minutes), the girl succumbs to her head injuries and blood loss. Subbu forgets about it but Rishi cannot. A drunk Rishi argues with Subbu that the life they are leading is not the life they must live. Enraged, Subbu points to Rishi the sordid life he is leading without earning his living, which makes Rishi leave.
The next day, Subbu gets a phone call from a police officer who tells him that Rishi has died in a road accident. A shocked Subbu and Anandi go to Kolkata for Rishi's funeral. There Anandi promises Subbu the shares if he will go with her to Doodh Kasi to scatter Rishi's ashes in the lake.
A major part of the remaining story deals with the journey of Subbu and Anandi to Doodh Kasi with the help of a guide Pemba and the change in the mindset of Subbu from a money-minded calculative person to one who learns to live in the moment. In the process, he has a chance encounter with a man named Robert who is a multi-billionaire but still has a rough journey planned in Himalayas. When Subbu asks him the reason, he says that for the last forty - forty five years of his life he has been running towards fame and money even extending his retirement, and keeping relations and enjoyable moments at bay. But when at last he wished to live life with his wife Mary, unfortunately, she died. Subbu also ends up helping a pregnant woman who was in labour and experiences joy when he lifts the baby into his arms. The remaining story also shows how love blooms between Subbu and Anandi. After having come back from Doodh Kasi, Subbu, now a changed man, cancels his engagement with Rhea and approaches Ramaiah to give his company back to him and also applies for the job in the same firm. The movie ends with Subbu asking Anandi to give him a 'share' in her life (meaning : he proposes her for the marriage, indirectly)."

1030,Bharath Stores,"Bharathi has come to Bengaluru after nine years with her husband, Sharath. She had promised her father that she would repay his dues to Mr Govinda Shetty. Only then did her father die in peace. Mr Govinda Shetty inherited the small grocery shop, ""Bharath Stores"" and was carrying on the family business with pride and such elan that the bus stop in front was named after it as ""Bharath stores stop"" After alighting near that stop, she was surprised to find no trace of it anywhere there. The queries to that effect went in vain.
Now the frantic search begins. By the fruition of a dedicated search, she meets Chandru and Manjunath, who had worked in that shop. Chandru tells her how he learnt along with the tricks of the trade, to be humane from him. Manjunath tells her, he stayed in the shop till the end until Shetty was hospitalized. He brings her to the old age home. Bharathi finds Shetty there gazing at nothing, having stopped speaking for months and unable to react to her.
Guess the reason behind Shetty's present status?
Certainly not the events in his life, like Balaji, his son showing contempt to the family business, his love marriage nor his leaving the house for ever. Shetty showed his strong willpower at such situations.
Globalisation, liberalisation and industrialisation brought the countries nearer. It is a couple of decades India also accepted these, resulting in the gradual change in the lifestyle. Malls and marts popped up. New ethics and style of business were adapted. Curious clientele gradually were being attracted to the mall culture. Repercussion was the deteriorating retail, small and box shops. Govinda Shetty too was a victim of the tsunami of this dangerous evolution. It is the status of lakhs and lakhs of those like him.
Bharathi's search unfolds the cruel reality of the invasion of mall culture. Many a gigantic question, appear and disturb us."

He yearns for adventure, wildlands, forests and animals. He wants to follow the footsteps of famous explorers like Livingstone, Mungo Park, Marco Polo, all of whom he has read about and idolizes.
By a stroke of luck, he secures a job as a station master in a desolate station in Uganda Railway through a fellow villager working there and goes to Africa without a second thought. One evening Shankar is chased by a man-eating lion and luckily he reaches his cabin and locks the door. The next day he asks the head stationmaster to provide him with a Springfield bolt-action rifle and carbolic acid as a day before he encounters another hazard in Africa: the poisonous black mamba. He miffs the black mamba with his torchlight. The next day he gets these things from another fellow Indian, Tirumal Appa, who is serving the British Army.
They quickly strike a rapport and Tirumal visits him often. One day Tirumal becomes a victim of the same man-eating lion. This rages Shankar and he decides to end this peril. He poses as bait by pouring blood on himself and scatters meat chunks. He tempts the lion out of his cave and eventually shoots him down.
He rescues and looks after the middle-age Portuguese explorer and gold prospector, Diego Alvarez. The encounter with Alavarez influences him deeply. Alavarez tells him of his exploits and adventures, how he and his companion Jim Carter had braved deep jungles and mountains of Richtersveld to find the largest diamond mine. However, they were thwarted by the legendary Bunyip, a mythical monster who guards the mines and killed Carter.
Shankar gives up his job and accompanies Alvarez as he decides to venture out once more and find the mines again. They meet with innumerable hardships. The first is a raging volcano which forces them to halt their expedition. One night they were attacked by the monster Bunyip. Eventually, they get lost in the forests where Alvarez is killed by the monster, in an effort to save Shankar's life. Desolated Shankar mourns the death of Alvarez deeply. He buries him with all rites and sets sail towards the mountain of the moon.
Shankar sets out to reach civilization. He finds the diamond mines by accident. He enters the cave and gets lost. With great difficulty, he gets out, marking his way with ""pebbles"" and taking some back with him as a memento, not knowing each is an uncut diamond. He finds the remains of the Italian explorer, Attilio Gatti, and learns that the cave he found earlier was the diamond mine. Gatti, as Shankar learns from a note by him, had uncut diamonds in his boots. The note said that whoever reads the note can take the diamonds as long as he buries his skeleton, with Christian rites. Shankar does so and keeps the old diamonds.
While crossing the jungle, he comes in contact with the Bunyip's cave. Filled with revenge, he devises a plan to get rid of Bunyip. Shankar collects sticks from the jungle and sharpens their tips into spears. He fences the entrance with sharpened wood and waits for the Bunyip. The Bunyip turns up and, seeing its prey, jumps at it from a height. Shankar moves out and the Bunyip gets pierced on the wood and dies.
Shankar tries to move out by following the compass. He becomes lost in the deserts of Kalahari and nearly dies of thirst. Fortunately, he is rescued by a survey team and taken to a hospital in Salisbury, Rhodesia. When he recovers he sells four of his diamonds and for much money. One diamond he sends to his parents with a note to sell it and help the villagers with its money. Next, he sells his sole diamond and buys a steamer boat to continue his exploration.
He ends by saying that he will return to that cave one day with a large team and continue the legacy of Alvarez, Carter and Gatti."

But they somehow manage to acquire a newly bought pair of clothes from a couple of rich children by buying them panipuri from a street vendor, much against the wishes of the rich boys' father, who had denied them the treat as he considered it unhygienic.
The happy brothers return to the pizza shop in their new dresses. Another group of slum boys who are envious and sceptical about the brothers' story about going to eat pizza follow them to take a video of what transpires with the brothers at the pizza shop. The brothers are once again confronted by the watchman and he now forces them to go home right away, but the boys protest by saying that they have money and are wearing new clothes. This argument attracts the attention of the pizzeria supervisor who comes out and slaps the older brother. This is caught on video by the other slum kids who laugh at the brothers' humiliation. The sad and disappointed brothers return to their slum only to be further overwhelmed by the miserable sight of their dead grandmother. The brothers feel guilty when they remember insulting their grandmother some time before.
When two men in the slum happen to watch the video of the boy being slapped, they try to make money by threatening the owner of the pizza shop to release the video to the media. The owner realises he could be imprisoned and his pizzeria sealed by the government due to his supervisor's act of discrimination and violence against slum children. He offers one of the men a hundred thousand rupees for not making the video public. The man agrees, but his associate releases it to the media hoping to make some money (unaware of the huge sum being offered). This stirs up tension amongst the pizzeria's owners who finally decide to publicly apologise to the slum kids. The boys are welcomed to the pizza spot in a red carpet reminiscent of Simbu being welcomed in the opening ceremony of the pizzeria. The owner also promises them free pizzas for life. Even as the brothers begin to finally enjoy their first pizza, they tell each other that the dosa-pizza which their grandmother had earlier made for them had tasted much better."

The film rewinds into a flashback. It is 2010. Kakababu is contracted by Egyptian businessman Al Mamun (Rajit Kapur) to decipher the meanings of hieroglyphic symbols that his teacher, Mufti Muhammad (Barun Chanda), had drawn on a piece of paper supposedly during his sleep. Muhammad is terminally ill and is about to grant his last wish while he is being treated in Delhi. Mamun thinks that the symbols are the key for locating Mufti Muhammad's will which will describe where to find treasures Mufti Muhammad had acquired during his tenure as a political leader and revolutionary. However, Kakababu is convinced that the symbols have a different meaning and they are very unusual. Mufti Muhammad symbolically requests Kakababu to verify something, a very unusual last wish.
Meanwhile, a war of rivalry ensues between Mamun and Hani Al Qadi (Indraneil Sengupta), another of Mufti Muhammad's disciples (and a rival of Mamun) who accuses Mamun of stealing a secret that isn't rightfully his. While in Delhi, there was an attempt to murder Kakababu, in which Kakababu was injured.

1090,Mithayi Mane,"Mithai Mane is the story of an 11-year-old girl named Ganga, who leaves from a poor village to work as a maid for a well-off family in the city. Her situation is compared throughout the movie to the plight of Gretel (held prisoner in the witch's cottage), and her story is interwoven with a voice-over narration of the Hansel and Gretel story. One of Ganga's tasks is to bring the household children's lunch boxes to their private school. At the school she is befriended by Swathi, a schoolgirl who wants to help her. As their friendship grows, Ganga becomes more aware of her surroundings. Child labor is at the heart of this film, but it is treated with gentle irony and there is no assignment of blame. The well-to-do family is self-absorbed and insensitive, not cruel and exploitative. The audience, however, has seen the plight of the villagers and the contrast with the opulence of the city-dwellers is obvious. The most powerful image is the open-eyed and honesty that Ganga brings with her from the village. These qualities will eventually force her to leave the sugar-coated house in the city where everything is a little too sweet. Ganga is played by child actor Aditi."

1111,Return of Hanuman,"Devas are ’busy’ in their Swarglok (heaven). Technology has crossed the boundaries of earth and even non-mortal devas have become techno-geeks. They converse in Hinglish. Meanwhile, a terrific war is being fought between the Devas and the Asuras. In this war, Lord Vishnu slices the demon Rahuketu into two parts through his stomach. His collapse invokes the Guru of Asuras, Guru Shukracharya and he comes forward to battle with Lord Vishnu. He also slices a large snake named Kaladansh into two parts. Lord Vishnu gains an upper hand in the war and throws Shukracharya into space. Shukracharya announces a prophecy throughout the Universe warning Lord Vishnu that the same humans whom he is protecting, in Kali Yuga they will themselves become very cruel than even demons and a day will come when their cruelty will give rise to the greatest demon of the Universe which will engulf the whole humankind. Shukracharya then transforms himself into Planet Shukra or Venus and it becomes the home of demons. Later he joins Rahuketu's sliced body with that of Kaladansh's tail and vice versa. This gives rise to two demons Rahu and Ketu. Shukracharya declares that as long as his Sarpdand i.e. Snake Wand lives, the demons will remain powerful.
Hanuman, who has just returned to heaven after completing his task on earth, is bored. He sees a village boy who is bullied by his classmates. He decides to help him, not as a God or an invisible force but as a human. He then asks Lord Brahma to allow him to take birth as a human being. Brahma allows but keeps some conditions which Hanuman agrees to accept. He appears on earth in a village named Bajrangpur from a priest and his wife as a human baby. What makes the reincarnated Hanuman different from other humans is that he has a tail and a huge appetite. The baby is named ""Maruti"" by his mother. After Maruti is three months old, he takes admission in the same school where the boy he wanted to help studies and befriends with him. Thereafter, he teaches a lesson to his bully classmates, Gabbar Singh and his gang.
Meanwhile, on planet Shukra, there is a fight between Rahu and Ketu and accidentally the Sarpdand comes to Earth. Danavs come to Earth to search for it but they have to face Maruti. Maruti easily defeats Rahu and Ketu with the help of his army of monkeys that came to help him to get free from the hands of culprits (who caught him because he stole the mangoes from his garden). In order to defeat Rahu and Ketu, Narada must remind Maruti that he is actually Hanuman. After Narada and Maruti meet, Maruti is reminded that he can turn to Hanuman as per his will. Maruti then turns to the more powerful Hanuman, with his godly powers. He still has the appearance of a child but looks like child Hanuman, the appearance from the film's predecessor. Then a monster made of polythene and other non-biodegradable waste appears from a volcano that was said to form when Sarpdand merged with the Kamandal thrown by Shukracharya which coincidentally fell into the volcano in Bajrangpur. The monsters keep on swallowing the villagers of Bajrangpur. After struggling to stop the monster, Hanuman asked for help from God Ram. God Ram then said that when a blockage, which is seen in the end, is cleared then the monster (mainly made of plastic and other waste thrown by humans) will finish up. Hanuman did what Ram said, and the monster was defeated. Finally, Hanuman said his farewells to his family and friends and leaves Bajrangpur."

They escape but Romeo feels there is no point staying as Laila said she never wanted to see him again, and Charlie badly wants her. The next morning, Romeo throws his sack onto an open train boxcar about to leave the station but Charlie arrives with Laila and the others. Charlie tells Romeo that he is a fool for leaving Laila when she still loves him, that he explained everything to her and says she is Romeo's and no one else's.

1114,Royal Bengal Rahashya (film),"On an invitation by Mahitosh Singha Ray, Lalmohon Babu takes Feluda and Topshe to a forest near Bhutan and stays at the ancestral home of Mahitosh Singha Ray. After few days of their arrival, Mahitosh Singha Ray's assistant, Tarit dies. His deadbody is found in the forest, and police believes he has died due to a tiger attack. But later they found a blood-stained sword near his body. Meanwhile, Mahitosh gives Feluda a riddle to solve. Feluda's amazing intelligence is proved in this part. He solves it most amazingly, and at the end, chalks out that a treasure chest is hidden 55 hands away from a tree which has a hole between it, which looks like an old person's mouth without any teeth; between two Arjuna trees. While Feluda and his companion are on the way to the treasure chest, they find Tarit's spectacles and later on, his torch, which suggests that Tarit has solved the puzzle much earlier than the others, and was on his way to the treasure chest. At last, Feluda finds the treasure chest, and holds out the conclusion. Mahitosh had broken his hand due to a fall from a tree, which Feluda came to know when he was unable to hold the rifle. All the precious huntings of the tiger were done by his friend, Shashanka. On that night, while Tarit was about to leave, Shashanka too followed him quietly. On seeing a tiger feeding on Tarit's corpse, Shashanka fired his rifle, which injured the tiger's nose after Feluda found a bit of skin. Tarit's sword, as he observed, has begun acting like a magnet, which was started by a bolt of lightning striking it, which kills Tarit in the process. Thus, Tarit wasn't murdered by any villain, but only, nature was the cause of his death. Hence, Feluda is rewarded with a part of the treasure."

1119,Sonar Kella,"The film begins with a school-boy Mukul Dhar (Kushal Chakraborty), who is said to be able to remember events of his previous life, and soon receives media attention. Dr. Hemanga Hajra (Sailen Mukherjee), a parapsychologist, offers his help, believing it might help him in his own research. Mukul always remains sombre and paints peacocks, forts, camels and battlescenes at midnight; he mentions that he lived in the Golden Fortress (Sonar Kella) and that their house had many gems. Dr. Hajra decides to take Mukul on a trip to Rajasthan, famous for forts, historical importance and desert landscape. Two seasoned fraudsters, Amiyanath Burman and Mandar Bose, plan to kidnap Mukul to capture the treasure. Their first attempt at the kidnapping fails when they pick up another boy, also named Mukul (Santanu Bagchi), from the same neighborhood. Alarmed by this, Mukul's father engages Pradosh Chandra Mitter a.k.a. Feluda (Soumitra Chatterjee), a private investigator, to protect his son. Feluda leaves for Rajasthan along with his cousin Tapesh a.k.a Topshe (Siddartha Chatterjee), following Dr. Hajra. On their way, they meet and befriend Lalmohan Ganguly, a.k.a. Jatayu (Santosh Dutta), a popular thriller writer.
Meanwhile, Burman and Bose kidnap Mukul and push Dr. Hajra off a cliff to his presumed death at the Nahargarh Fort in Jaipur. Burman impersonates as Dr. Hajra and Bose impersonates as a globe-trotter. Dr. Hajra actually survived the fall and begins to pursue them. Feluda arrives in Jodhpur Circuit House and meets Burman, assuming him to be Dr. Hajra. Feluda begins to suspect Bose based on his clothes and his accent. Feluda even suspects ""Dr. Hajra's"" conduct as he appears lackadaisical in his research. Mukul keeps saying he is followed by a ""bad man"". Burman successfully hypnotizes Mukul, who says that the Golden Fortress is in Jaisalmer. Dr. Hajra reaches to the same conclusion by learning about the history of the Fort of Jaisalmer from a police inspector. Feluda learns that the Jaisalmer Fort is made of yellow limestone, giving it a golden glow. Bose lies to Feluda by saying that Burman/Dr. Hajra has already left with Mukul for Barmer, in order to lure Feluda on the wrong track. Feluda suspects foul play but cannot be sure. By chance, his eye falls upon the card of Dr Hajra; an idea flashes in his mind and he rushes to check the register of the circuit house and finds that it is signed as 'Hazra' not 'Hajra'. He is now sure about the man impersonating as Dr Hajra, and  leaves for Jaisalmer by car. Bose strands Feluda, Topshe, and Jatayu on the highway. Feluda takes a camel caravan to the nearest train station, from which he takes the next train to Jaisalmer. At night, in the train, Bose attacks and attempts to stab Feluda to death, who anticipated the attack and nearly defeats him; eventually, Bose falls out of the train and most probably dies after seeing the real Dr. Hajra in a separate compartment of the same train and assuming him to be a ghost. The trio arrive in Jaisalmer along with Dr. Hajra. They rush to the fort, where they find Burman searching for the treasure where Mukul recalled his home of previous life was. Feluda confronts and captures Burman, telling him that there never was any treasure. They find that Mukul is cured of his obsession of previous life, and they return to Kolkata."
1120,Stanley Ka Dabba,"Stanley (Partho Gupte) is a fourth grader at Holy Family school in Mumbai and is very popular among his friends. He is talented and well liked by his peers. The English teacher, Ms. Rosy, (Divya Dutta) is particularly impressed with his creativity, wit, and humour.  Stanley is shown with a bruised face in the opening scene of the movie. On being questioned about it by Ms. Rosy, he concocts an elaborate story, much to her amusement. His humorous essays and offhand poem recitations make him her favourite in class. However his imagination is not always rewarded; his science teacher (Divya Jagdale) rebukes his attempt at constructing a light house as part of the class project since it does not adhere to the topics covered in class.
It is shown early on that he doesn't bring his lunch box or 'dabba' to school, unlike all his other classmates. Verma (Amole Gupte) is a ravenous Hindi teacher; a phagomaniac who does not bring his own dabba either but lusts after everyone else's, also stealing food on occasion. The kids at school nickname him as 'Khadoos' (cantankerous person). He has a poor reputation among his peers for his mindless and inconsiderate gluttony. He particularly eyes the dabba of one of Stanley's friends and shamelessly joins the group in class as soon as the lunch bell goes off to gorge on their food. A lot of his class time is spent discussing what his students brought for lunch.
One day, he ends up coming late during lunch-break and misses out on eating what he had earlier hoped to eat from the children's dabbas. Upon realising that the food in question was shared with Stanley, Khadoos berates him for not getting his own dabba. Stanley senses Khadoos' hostility towards him and avoids eating from his friends' dabbas thereafter, telling them every day during lunch break that he is going home to enjoy a hot meal prepared by his mother. His friends catch his bluff soon after when they find him loitering around the school during lunch break. When confronted, Stanley tells them that there is no one to cook for him until his parents get back from Delhi. Eager to help their hungry friend out, Stanley's friends start hiding from Khadoos during lunch break while sharing their dabbas with Stanley. Chagrined, Khadoos starts hunting for them arduously during lunch break every day. He catches hold of them eventually on the terrace, empty dabbas in tow. Upon realising that the group shared their lunches with Stanley again, he menacingly threatens Stanley to either bring his own dabba or stop coming to school. Stanley obliges and stops coming to school.
In this time, Stanley's friends come to know of an inter-school concert that they think he would be a perfect fit for. However, since he is debarred from school by Khadoos, Stanley remains sceptical about his chances. He secretly starts attending practice sessions for the concert and begins learning the dance steps and song lyrics by himself. Soon after, he is spotted practising by one of the organizers of the concert. His talent is recognised and he is immediately included in the troupe. In the meantime, Stanley's absence is felt by his teachers and friends, who finally spill the beans to Ms. Rosy about the reason behind his nonattendance. Aghast and disgusted, Ms. Rosy confronts Khadoos in front of other staff members asking him to ""have some shame"" since Stanley ""is just a child"". Khadoos begins realising his folly.
One fine day, Stanley brings his own dabba to school. He offers it to Khadoos on a platter and asks him for permission to come back to school. Guilt-ridden and shame-faced, Khadoos resigns from his post. He apologises to Stanley in a handwritten letter and promises to never return.
Meanwhile, the inter-school concert is attended by the entire staff of Holy Family, all of whom appreciate Stanley's performance. Ms. Rosy congratulates Stanley after the concert and offers him a ride home. However, he refuses saying that his mother is waiting for him in her car. The school's Principal (Rahul Singh) later drops Stanley home, which we realise isn't ""home"" but the restaurant at which he works. An orphan, Stanley is frequently physically abused by the proprietor of the restaurant (his own uncle – Shashank Shende), leaving him badly bruised. He hits Stanley in the face for remaining absent from work for the majority of the day. A cook at the restaurant, Akram, empathises with Stanley and promises to pack leftovers at the restaurant into his 'dabba' every day, without his uncle's knowledge. Stanley and Akram stay back and clean the place up for the night. The scene ends with Stanley lighting a candle next to a photograph of his parents, before going to bed. The next day onward, Stanley brings his own dabba to school and shares it with everyone while regaling them with details about how his mother prepared everything."

He is depressed by the fact that he has to become a doctor, just because his father is a famous doctor. When he first witnesses M Bhai's ability to get away with crime during a Hindu religious celebration, Rege becomes enamored at his power. He and his friend Pakya decide to join M Bhai's gang activities, bullying citizens, bribing police, and spending time at brothels. Rege's father, a successful doctor and dean of a hospital, becomes suspicious of Rege's whereabouts, but Rege assures him everything is fine.
Meanwhile, police inspector Pradeep Sharma, who is accused of laundering money to pay for expensive properties managed by Agrawal Industries, is an expert in encounters and strong-arms gangsters into bending to his whim. He crosses paths with M Bhai's goons when he crashes a wedding celebration, but M Bhai and his men escape just in time. Sharma and his right-hand man, Sachin Waze, uses their own men to track them down.
Rege's friends try to get him to run for secretary in elections, but this is stalled after another candidate uses his criminal relations to convince Rege to drop out. However, the opposing candidate realizes Rege's connections with M Bhai and he himself drops out instead. Rege tells his friends to go, and they start to become concerned with his entanglements with his gangster friends. M Bhai then takes Rege along with his men to have some ""fun"", however they instead go on a mission to kill off Agarawal (of Agarawal Industries) who manages Pradeep Sharma's properties. 
Back in the present, the Pradeep Sharma is jail and is in complete control of his case. His lieutenant Waze is now managing the show.

He is picked up by Sharma's men and brought to the police station where he is interrogated and threatened with violence. Rege is extremely scared and repents for what he has done. However, Sharma comes to the station and reasons with Rege privately in congenial manner to spill everything that happened with M Bhai's gang. As Rege reveals the events, Sharma realizes M Bhai could still be at Rege's farmhouse. Sharma's men head over with Rege and capture M Bhai and his men, who are soon after executed in a crop field. Rege feels guilty and foolish as Sharma lets him go home. But in the climax, it is revealed that Sharma killed Rege just to complete his century (100) of encounters when Waze persuades him by telling him that,""Sachin Tendulkar had waited for a year to complete his century of centuries"".

Together with an ostentatious crew led by Tayaji and cousin Jassi, he routinely indulges in cocaine consumption. Tommy is popular for his energetic songs with lyrics that often glorify violence and drug addiction. However, his addiction costs him his music contract and lands him in jail. While in prison, he meets two of his die-hard fans who remark how Tommy's lifestyle had 'inspired' theirs, leading them to murder their own mother for drug money. Realizing that his songs have negatively affected teenagers, Tommy decides to change his ways upon release. A few days later, he engages in an altercation and inadvertently shoots Tayaji, injuring his ear. This causes Tayaji to send Tommy and his crew away to a farmhouse so that he can prepare for an upcoming concert.
Working on the farm is a migrant worker from Bihar nicknamed Bauria, whose dreams of playing national-level hockey for the country were shattered due to her father's death, pushing her to Punjab to work as a laborer. She works for a local landlord who uses agriculture as a front for drug-peddling. One night, she finds a suspicious packet on the farm and realizes that it is some kind of a drug. She resolves to sell it but her search for a potential buyer lands her in trouble as she unwittingly contacts the original owners of the heroin. She is captured by the gang of drug peddlers but not before she discards it into a well. As a compensation for their lost drugs, the peddlers forcibly keep her at their house, where she is sexually and physically abused, given drugs, and pimped to men. Some weeks later, she manages to escape.
Over in the neighboring town lives Preet Sahni, a doctor and activist who runs a rehabilitation center. Sartaj Singh is a junior policeman who knows about the drug smuggling his seniors are allowing on a large scale. But when it affects his family, as his brother, Balli, overdoses and is brought to Preet's clinic, he realizes the grave situation. Preet and Sartaj decide to find the root cause of the problem together. Balli is admitted into her drug rehabilitation centre against his will.
At his concert, instead of singing, Tommy starts preaching. Infuriated by his speech about how one should lead one's life, his fans start throwing bottles at him. The angered Tommy urinates in front of the crowd before fleeing. He hides in an old structure and meets Bauria, also hiding. The two share their stories and bond. However, Bauria is recaptured by the same gang when she defends Tommy from being attacked by them. He learns the next day that an arrest warrant has been issued for him because of the public ruckus at the concert, and sets out to find Bauria after realising his feelings for her.
Preet and Sartaj find that the driving force behind the drug problem in Punjab is an elderly man called Virender Singh, who has flourished with the support of his father-in-law, MP Maninder Brar. The two go to extreme measures to collect evidence against the politician and put together a report to be sent to the state's Election Commission to thwart Brar's campaign for another term in power. Sartaj and Preet fall in love; however, one night, Preet sees a manic Balli trying to escape from her rehab center. On trying to stop him, she is accidentally stabbed in the neck by him. As Balli is Sartaj's brother, senior officer Jhujar Singh who investigates the homicide decides to send him underground. While falsifying the crime scene he comes across the report made by her and Sartaj, and is infuriated when he sees that he too has been named in the drug racket. He calls Sartaj and knocks him out when he arrives.
Waking up in the presence of the local drug mafia at their farmhouse, where Bauria is also confined, a bruised and beaten Sartaj is questioned by Jhujar, who is a key member in the drug racket. Sartaj says whatever he did was for the sake of Punjab. At the same time, Tommy enters the house, armed with a hockey stick. Taking advantage of the distraction, Sartaj grabs Jhujar's gun and shoots the whole gang before freeing Balli. Tommy helps Bauria escape from her captors. Balli kneels and cries in front of his brother, whose face is expressionless.
Eventually, it is shown that the government issued an inquiry into Brar's activities and there has been a huge crackdown on the drug menace. Over in Goa, amidst his crew members, Tommy calls Bauria to ask for her real name. Sitting by the beach, she catches sight of a foreigner having fun. Inspired, she says ""Mary Jane"", to which Tommy flirtatiously replies that she is his ""life"", and she ends the call before going for a swim."

One of Rakesh's friends (played by Asokan) meets Krishnanunni (Jagadish), an Income Tax Inspector (a Finance Ministry employee in Veber's script), on a bus trip and decides that he could probably be a source of entertainment for Rakesh. Rakesh promptly calls Krishnanunni and invites him for dinner.
Krishnanunni is a talkative self-promoting singer (in Veber's script, passionate in building replicas of landmarks with matchsticks) who carries with him a photo album showcasing his musical life. He is excited at the prospect of meeting a music producer which might help advance his career as a singer. Krishnanunni is kind-hearted and wants to help everyone but he also has the ability to mess things up for people around him. He can be annoying to the person who is sitting next to him but he makes it a funny experience for everyone else watching him.
Friday arrives but Rakesh accidentally falls into a swimming pool and gets injured (a golf injury, in Veber's script). His back is sprained badly and is restricted from moving around.

Krishnanunni does so by calling Rakesh's wife, who had been involved in a car accident after leaving the apartment for the second time (the first time being when Krishnanunni had sent her away thinking she was really Rakesh's ex-girlfriend), and makes no mistakes in this conversation, as well as making up near perfect excuses on the spot and with no prompting.

The sons give their salaries to their father, and all the financial matters are dealt by him efficiently. He is respected and feared by everyone in the family. Wrong-doers in the household are made to stand on a bench by him as punishment.
Meanwhile, a popular actress Bama moves into the bungalow next to their house. The three daughters-in-law and the sons meet her while they are all in the terrace, and try to make friends with her.

Now, the three ladies in the house start making fuss about the condition of their house, saying that they do not have enough facilities in their house to show to Bama that there are well-off. The husbands try to convince them but they force their husbands to agree to whatever they ask. Eventually the men give in and start buying things for their own houses. They paint the house, get stuff like radio, fan, sofa, for their own portions.
The father tries in vain to make everyone understand that they should live for themselves within their means.

Later when Bama goes to Parvathi's portion, Parvathi lies that her husband is college principal. When she tells that she has only two children, Sita lets the other three kids out of the locked room. Bama thinks that the kids are orphans, and Parvathi, who does not know English, agrees that the kids are orphans. Sita makes fun of this. Finally, when Bama arrives at Krishnan's part of the house, she gets a spectacular welcome with red carpet, flowers and her favourite drinks. They even take a few snaps with her.
The ladies are amazed by Bama's simplicity like glass bangles, her politeness. Even then they do not take a cue, and try to show off too much in front of her.

1215,Bey Yaar,"Childhood friends Chintan ""Chako"" (Divyang Thakkar) and Tapan ""Tino"" (Pratik Gandhi) aspire to invest in a real estate project called The Other Side, located near the scenic Nal Savorar area and their residence of Ahmedabad. They currently work as MRs while hoping to make quick money through a Godman who promises to triple their profit. The Godman turns out to be part of a larger con and his scheme is discovered by the police. As a result, Chako and Tino are scammed out of ₹1,80,000 (or 180,000 rupees).
Chako's father, Jeetu (Darshan Jariwala), runs a small local tea stall, in which hangs a painting from a prominent artist named M.F. Hassan (based on the late M.F. Husain). The piece was gifted to Jeetu as a sign of their close friendship, before Hassan's rise to prominence and eventual death. Upon learning that Jeetu's tea stall painting is highly coveted, Tino comes up with another idea to secure an investment with The Other Side: secretly replace the painting with an identical fake one, and then loan the original for cash. Initially hesitant but desperate, Chako assists in the plan along with their friend Uday (Kavin Dave), an avid painter who begrudgingly agrees to compose an exact copy of the piece himself.
With the switch successful, Chako and Tino mortgage the original painting to a local art dealer, Y.B. Gandhi (Manoj Joshi). Shortly thereafter, however, Gandhi informs Chako that the painting he received is fake and that someone else had tried to sell the same painting to another dealer. Gandhi convinces Chako that either Tino had double-crossed him, or that his father had been lying about the painting's authenticity. Chako returns the money back to Gandhi, and angrily confronts Tino, who indeed went to a separate dealer, but was sent by Uday for an art survey only. Chako then meets his father and accuses him of confabulating a friendship. Angered by the accusations and hurt by Chako's loss of the painting, Jeetu kicks him out of the house.
The M.F. Hassan painting, however, was an original all along, and Gandhi - whom Hassan hated and never lent his work  to - had cheated Chako and Tino out of the painting. Gandhi then publicly humiliates Jeetu by telling the press he never had a friendship with Hassan, and that the stories of him making his paintings at the tea stall are all false.
Hoping to redeem themselves, Chako and Tino devise a plan to take advantage of Gandhi's own greed in order to get the painting back for Jeetu. Helping with the elaborate scheme include Uday and Jigisha (Samvedna Suwalka), Tino's girlfriend. They hire a method actor named Pranav (Amit Mistry) to pose as ""Prabodh Gupta"", a fictitious international artist from Bihar whose work has yet to be exhibited in India. The group successfully lures Gandhi into funding a fabricated NGO and conducting Prabodh's supposed lucrative first exhibition in India, in exchange for the tea stall painting.
Pranav and Uday narrowly retrieve the painting on the day of the held exhibition, just as Gandhi realizes that Prabodh is a fraud. He confronts the place of the fake NGO but encounters Chako, Tino, and Jeetu. Chako and Tino demand that he publicly retract his earlier statements about Jeetu, or else be arrested for selling fake paintings and creating the fictitious ""Prabodh Gupta"" himself (since Gandhi was tricked earlier into funding the fake NGO). Realizing his defeat, Gandhi tries to offer money, but Jeetu declines and chastises him for his greed being the reason Hassan never worked with large art curators.
Gandhi holds a televised news conference the next morning, apologizing for his previous accusations against Jeetu. Hassan's piece is returned to Jeetu's shop, after he and Chako fully reconcile. Uday, whose own paintings were used as Prabodh's work from earlier, is offered his own local exhibition, attended by much happier Chako and Tino."

Since then, Padmanabhan has been living a very thrifty life, always counting the cost of his daily expenses.

He drags his two children out of the house and they burst into tears at the prospect of having to leave because they do not wish to do so. The weeping boys then plead with Padmanabhan to let them stay and promise him that they will buy him a much bigger house when they grow up. Padmanabhan, moved to tears, recalls his own heartbreak at being dragged out of his childhood home and agrees to let the family stay until the children have grown up. This puts the money lender to shame and contrition, and he admits having arranged for Padmanabhan's money to be stolen because he knew that he would raise the money eventually. He returns the money and asks for Padmanabhan's forgiveness, having realised the strength of his adversary's moral character.

Bimmo meanwhile tries to make passing the exams difficult for Chaudhary, by arranging the release of the prisoner who is helping him with Science, and setting the Examination Time Table in such a way that Hindi exam comes first. Jyoti, beginning to see the change in character that the focus on education has brought on in Chaudhary, agrees to help him. As they make progress, they develop mutual respect.
Chaudhary's bail application is processed and he is cleared for release, but Jyoti hides this from him so he can focus on his studies. Chaudhary appears for his exams but is uncertain of how he has performed. When he is released, he finds out about Jyoti hiding the sanctioning of his bail application. When Jyoti remarks how education has changed him for the better and advises him to help the public with his newly acquired education, Chaudhary brushes her off and tells her that he'll never change; Jyoti is disappointed by his intransigence. But when Chaudhary returns to the political arena, he discovers that Bimmo has usurped the CM chair and he has no support in his own party. None of his ministers want to endanger their position by taking his side in the couple-struggle. This makes Chaudhary join the coalition party in the government, and topples the government. General elections are declared, and all groups campgain vigorously. The election results and exam results are due on the same day. While votes are being counted, Chaudhary rushes back to jail to discover that he has passed the exams. As a token of gratitude, he gifts Jyoti a chair that he'd made in the workshop as her Gurudakshina (traditionally a gift given by a student to a teacher). His new party wins the election and Chaudhary reconciles with Bimmo. He refuses the Chief Minister post and chooses to become the Minister of Education instead. During his oath ceremony, he makes it a point to convey his gratitude to Jyoti and the other inmates who helped him clear the exams."

1267,Doctor G,"Dr. Uday Gupta is a medical student who has just finished his final medical professional exam. He lives in Bhopal with his widowed mother Shobha, an aspiring chef who hopes to make it big on social media through her cookery channels, and his tenant-cum-best friend, Chaddi, who is preparing for the civil services examination. Uday wants to pursue his post-graduation in orthopaedics, inspired by his distant cousin Dr. Ashok Gupta. His rank in the competitive entrance test, however, is insufficient for an orthopaedics course in Bhopal. Unwilling to leave his mother behind and move to another city for his studies, Uday reluctantly opts for the best available option in Bhopal—gynaecology. Ashok also advises Uday to take this opportunity; Uday can simultaneously continue to study for next year's entrance test. Uday is introduced to Kavya Sharma, a high school student who also aspires to become a doctor and whom Ashok is infatuated with.
Uday's initiation into gynaecology starts on a bad note—he is instantly ticked off by the head of the department, the strict Dr. Nandini Srivastav, for joining the course 10 days late, and he gets bullied by his colleagues, all of whom are female. Uday blames his ex-girlfriend Ruchi for his present state and, egged on by Ashok, drunkenly calls her and vents his frustrations. His lack of interest at work and his mistakes irritate Nandini, who asks Uday why he doesn't want to become a gynaecologist. Uday replies that male gynaecologists tend not to do well because patients prefer a female doctor examining them. Nandini rubbishes this and asks him to lose his ""male touch"". Following this, Uday gradually befriends his colleagues, especially his senior, Dr. Fatima Siddiqui. Eventually, he falls for her and the two share a passionate kiss, although Fatima dismisses the act as nothing serious, reminding a disappointed Uday that while he is a good friend, she is set to marry the man she loves, Arif. She also invites him to their engagement.
On a day the hospital is understaffed, Uday tries to examine a female patient without a female attendant, an act considered unethical. A fight breaks out and the patient and her husband later formally complain against him. While facing a disciplinary enquiry, Uday performs his first delivery in the hospital, a case of precipitate labour. The grateful family, who had lost two pregnancies before, name the baby after him. Uday finally understands his duty as a doctor towards his patients. At the enquiry, testimonies of Uday's colleagues clear his name. Nandini, though, remains unimpressed.
Uday tries to confess his love to Fatima at a dinner date, but his mother Shobha's entry complicates things and Fatima storms off. Meanwhile, Ashok has got Kavya pregnant and needs to get an abortion. A prominent doctor and married with two children, Ashok cannot go with Kavya to a hospital himself, so he asks Uday to take her. Check-ups reveal that Kavya has placenta praevia, making abortion difficult. Nandini refuses when Uday requests her to perform the operation herself, stating that it might threaten Kavya's life and thus her family should be informed first. Ashok asks Uday to keep Kavya at his home for the time being, and the two bond well. Kavya tells him that she had first doubted Ashok's character the day he had encouraged Uday to call and rant against Ruchi; Uday feels ashamed of his past behaviour.
On the day of the engagement, Ashok calls Uday and tells him to take Kavya to his clinic, because he has ""come up with a solution"". Arriving home, Uday is shocked to find his mother partying with an elderly stranger, who turns out to be her Tinder date. Infuriated, Uday orders both the old man and Chaddi—who had helped Shobha get on Tinder in the first place—out of the house. When Uday claims that he has made sacrifices for her sake, his mother snaps back, relating the difficulties she had raising him as a single mother. Now that her son has grown up, she now desires companionship. Mother and son then make peace.
Soon, Uday receives a call from Kavya—she is in intense pain after receiving an injection at a private clinic. He and Shobha rescue her and rush her to the hospital, where Nandini performs an emergency operation and saves her life. Ashok arrives at the hospital and confronts Uday, but he hits back. Since Kavya is a minor and below the age of consent, the matter is turned over to the police, who arrest Ashok for statutory rape. Uday again has to face an enquiry, and possible rustication, for lying to Nandini about Kavya's age earlier. Nandini, however, sees that Uday is now a changed man, and decides against punishing him. An overjoyed Uday rushes to Fatima's engagement, and proposes to remain her true friend forever."

Dolly's younger cousin Kajal has recently arrived from rural Bihar to chase her dreams and aspirations in the city. When Kajal tells Dolly that Amit makes unwanted advances towards her, Dolly puts it down to misunderstanding and laughs it off. Uncomfortable with her situation, Kajal looks to move out of Dolly's home but this is made difficult by her lack of qualifications.
Eventually, Kajal takes up a job at a call center for Red Rose Romance, a paid dating app where men can call in and speak to the women of their fantasies. After working through the initial shock of realization that most men call the app demanding phone sex, she takes on the identity of ""Kitty"" and becomes an expert at navigating tricky calls.

When Shazia breaks up with Gujjar, Kajal becomes intimate with him and is able to achieve orgasm through oral sex.
Dolly becomes intimate with Osmaan. When they have sex, she enjoys it, realizing that her lack of sexual satisfaction with Amit is not a result of a clinical disorder, but stems from a lack of desire. Kajal's office is vandalized by the political goons, and several of the women working at the call center quit their jobs, fearing for their safety.  Kajal, Dolly, and her family visit a local fair for the unveiling of a new structure by a feminist artist. Kajal comes across Pradeep, who promises to leave his family for her, but she rejects him.

He spends his hours in the hostel which is the best part of his life, by 'giving it those ones' — indulging in daydreams of social uplift. His latest idea is to plant fruit trees on either side of railway tracks, where rural India defecates daily. The faecal matter will provide the necessary compost for the trees, while the trains, with sprinklers attached, will automatically water the plants.
Annie keeps two hens in his room and earns a modest sum by selling their eggs, until one day his friend, Mankind, and his Ugandan roommate, Kasozi, make a roasted meal out of them. Soon, however, hirsute Arjun and his girlfriend Radha — a non-conformist student who steals cigarettes from Yamdoot and talks back to the teachers — present Annie with a rabbit.
Many adventures later, the day to submit the thesis draws near. Annie, urged by his friends, apologises to Yamdoot. A panel of judges call the students one by one for their final interviews and the tension mounts. Radha goes dressed in a saree but wears a man's hat to detract from her sober attire. To make sure that Annie gets a sympathetic hearing from the hostile panel, Radha and Arjun work out a plan. Just when Annie is called in, Yamdoot receives a phone call from his dominating deep-voiced mother,(who in actuality is Mankind). The trick works and the weary panel gives Annie a good grade.
At the party after the graduation ceremony, Annie arrives with heavy books under his arm, his hair shaved off and a butterfly painted on his head. He informs his friends that he has decided to study law and then sue Yamdoot. But subsequently, Annie became an Associate Professor of Design at the National Institute of Architecture, a year after Yamdoot's retirement."

1340,Kasethan Kadavulada,"Lakshmi, a domineering woman, controls all her husband Sivaswamy's money, treating him with scorn and disdain. When Ramu, Sivaswamy's son from his first wife, requires a sum of ₹3,000 (equivalent to ₹110,000 or US$1,400 in 2020) for his sister's husband, the stingy Lakshmi instantly refuses. Ramu and his cousin Mali hatch a plot with their tea vendor friend Appaswamy, who pretends to be a godman named Badrinath Swamy Sukranada to get to her money safe and steal a sum of ₹50,000. Meanwhile, Rama is an orphan whose only friend is Iruthayam, the doctor of a mental institution. When Rama wants a conduct certificate, Iruthayam bungles and hands over the certificate of an insane girl also named Rama.
DSP Paramantham, who previously arrested Appaswamy, comes to see the godman. Appaswamy tells Paramantham to not handle any cases at this time. An incident occurs when Rama encounters Appaswamy without a beard, but to his surprise she does not recognise the difference. The house receives a telegram saying that the real Badrinath Swamy Sukranada is arriving in two days, meaning Appaswamy has to loot his sum within that time frame. Lakshmi's brother Mani wants to buy jewellery for his girlfriend, Latha, and needs money after being exposed by his girlfriend's brother. Mani steals Appaswamy's money ₹5,001 that he received as a donation from Lakshmi (the extra ₹1 came from Chettiar), but Rama catches him red-handed.
The sane Rama arrives at Lakshmi's house to work as a secretary. Lakshmi sees the certificate, but decides to keep her at her house since the certificate mentions that Rama becomes violent when somebody refuses to give her what she wants. Rama falls in love with Ramu. The insane Rama and her father also come there to work coincidentally. More complications arise (the insane Rama's father overhears Ramu and Appaswamy's heist plan and subsequently the insane Rama lets her anger out on Appaswamy, leading to a deal in which Ramu and Appaswamy will not tell anybody that the sane Rama is insane as nobody knows and that the insane Rama's father will not tell anybody about the heist plan), leading to more incidents.
Lakshmi tells Appaswamy about the cash she has stashed in her secret hideout, and shows him how to access it. Appaswamy and Ramu succeed in their heist later that night, but are exposed after they place the cash in a flower pot. The insane Rama's father, the sane Rama, and Mani all encounter the cash. Mani throws it outside to his Latha's brother. Again, Rama catches him red-handed. The cash is in Latha's brothers' coat. To prove that the other Rama is truly insane, the sane Rama tells the insane Rama that the coat will look good on her. When Latha's brother refuses to give her his coat, the insane Rama shows her insanity. As a result, all problems are solved, Lakshmi is pacified, and agrees to Ramu and the sane Rama's marriage."

The tortoise — Rajaram P. Joshi (Naseeruddin Shah)  — is a middle-class clerk living in a chawl (a common lower middle-class apartment complex which has several families living in small rooms with common toilets) in Bombay. He is secretly in love with his neighbour Sandhya Sabnis (Deepti Naval), but is unable to express his love due to his timid nature. Rajaram is a good natured and hardworking man. His neighbours and colleagues take advantage of his simplicity.
One day Rajaram's smooth-talking, roguish friend Vasudev aka Bashu (Farooque Shaikh) — the hare — comes visiting as a house guest and makes himself at home in the chawl. Bashu makes a good impression on everybody by his charming, friendly behaviour, his extraordinary good looks and exaggerated stories of success.
Bashu starts wooing Sandhya, and she falls in love with him. He then joins Rajaram's company Footprint Shoes by impressing the owner Mr. Dhindhoria with untrue stories about his work experience in ""good 'ol' England"" and his newfound love of golf. Dhindhoria has a passion for golf and is easily impressed. Typically, Bashu soon starts flirting with Dhindhoria's beautiful and young wife Anuradha (Mallika Sarabhai) as well as his daughter Jojo (Winnie Paranjape) by his first marriage, courting both women at the same time.
In the chawl, meanwhile, the Sabnis family decides to get Sandhya married to Bashu much to Rajaram's shock and disappointment. But on the day of the engagement Bashu disappears. The footloose and fancy free youth does not wish to be tied down by marriage. The engagement is called off. Rajaram then offers to marry the devastated Sandhya, but she hints that she has been very intimate with Bashu and is therefore unworthy of Rajaram. Still, Rajaram shows his love by offering to accept her and finally expresses his long repressed love towards her. They get married. Meanwhile, Bashu ensnares an Arab employer and flies off to the Middle East on his next adventure."

He devises a plan to obtain the winning ticket and present it to the commission as his own. He hosts a dinner (mortgaging his wife's beloved pet goat Gattu who is like a child to her, to the Thakurani to pay for it) and invites all the villagers who play the lottery, but the man he is looking for does not turn up.

The secret soon becomes impossible to keep, and Lilaram must figure out how to fool the lottery inspector (Arbaaz Khan), who is on high way to the village to interview Anthony. To cover up the whole incident as per the plan of Lilaram, Ballu acted as living Antony and the inspector became satisfied.

At the onset, we see a suitcase of some significance being moved through the busy city. The bag is handed off by various men in suits until it reaches an older gentleman. The old man soon is pursued by some hoodlums. He narrowly escapes the thugs by hopping into a cab, only for the driver to stop the car in a secluded area. The mysterious driver then kills the old man dead with a gunshot and steals the bag and is shown running in the distance.
The film then begins to follow four friends in the same city. Vijay (Chunky Pandey), Appu Khote (Laxmikant Berde), Prem (Virendra Singh) and Thomas (Raj Zutshi) are a carefree bunch with no responsibilities that roam their part of town in search of fun and beautiful women.
The film takes a turn when they hear about a beautiful young woman that has just moved into their neighborhood with her grandparents. They are instantly allured by her good looks and start to make hilarious attempts to find out about her and why she is in town. In their quest to learn about the girl and impress her, they end up accidentally injuring Maya's grandfather and terrorizing her grandmother.  They discover that the girl, whose name is Maya (Meena) is visiting the city to get to the bottom of a mystery surrounding her dead brother, Raghuveer (Pankaj Dheer). In town, Maya is able to track down the mother (Reema Lagoo) of his brother's friend, Androze. The mother had been anxiously awaiting the return of her son from a long leave of absence and in that time had met Maya's brother Raghuveer, who left a special package for her from her long-lost son. We later find out that this package is the suitcase seen at the beginning of the film.
All four friends after learning about Maya and her reasoning for visiting the town decide to lie and pretend that the four of them were good friends with Maya's brother Raghuveer and Androze. After failed individual attempts to win her over, Maya eventually befriends the foursome. Once this happens, a powerful man by the name of John Honai (Kiran Kumar) appears to be stalking the four.
Honai tricks Vijay and his friends into coming to a warehouse, telling them that Maya wanted to meet them there. It is there that Vijay, Appu, Thomas and Prem are cornered by Honai and his gang of henchman. Honai, under the impression that the four are true friends of Androze and Raghuveer, demands that they reveal the whereabouts of the suitcase bag. The four are confused by the interrogation and deny they know anything about this bag. After failing to escape the warehouse, Honai holds the four hostage and subjects them to torture until they give up the whereabouts of the bag.
Meanwhile, Maya tracks down Androze's old girlfriend Annie Phillips (Malvika Tiwari), who is now currently a nun in a convent, going by the name Sister Josephine. The nun spills the story that Maya was looking for. The film flashes back to how the Androze family was doing business with the Honai family and after some problems, the two parties had a falling out and there was a fortune that belonged to the Androze father. The Honai family killed Androze father for the fortune, which was kept in a suitcase bag. Androze was able to retrieve the bag by killing John Honai's father. After escaping a gang beating from John Honai and his henchmen, Androze brings the bag to his good friend Raghuveer to take care of and deliver it to his mother. Soon thereafter, Raghuveer finds Androze's dead body at the shore of a beach and vows to get revenge. Raghuveer brings the bag to John Honai and tries to kill Honai, but fails after he's choked to death by Honai's henchmen with a rope as he has Honai in a chokehold. Honai checks the bag only to see that it was a decoy bag full of bricks.
Back to the present, Vijay and his friends cleverly escape the warehouse. Vijay and his friends find out that they are in big trouble as the police are now also after them after being mistaken as thugs. The four fail to retrieve the bag from the Androze's mother once they fess up that they lied about being his friend. Androze's mother scolds them and doesn't give up the bag. Honai finds out where Maya lives and kidnaps her. Vijay, Appu and the gang are able to save her from Honai's grasp in a big fight scene near the end of the movie.
Honai finds out where The Androze's mother lives and tries to retrieve the bag. Honai reveals to Androze's mother that he killed her son, which devastates her. She cuts the lights off in her house and earlier was cooking in the kitchen and had not turned the gas off. Honai scans through the dark house for her and ignites a lighter to try to see in the dark only for an explosion to occur, burning him alive.
With Maya now at peace after getting justice for her brother's death, she now heads back to her own town.  The movie ends with the mysterious bag busting open with a fortune of money and gold inside, and Maya yells out to her four friends that this is a gift for them to enjoy."

Thenali reaches Kailash's house. He falls in love with Janaki, Kailash's younger sister, which is vehemently opposed by the latter. Kailash becomes increasingly mad with Thenali's antics and even begins to suspect that his wife has an affair with Thenali, as she has a soft corner for the latter. He even tries to kill Thenali by tying him to a tree with a time bomb. Thenali, thinking it is a fake bomb used only to relieve him from his fears, removes it and puts it in Kailash's house where it explodes. Seeing this, Kailash suffers a paralytic attack. Thenali later marries Janaki.

1538,Thillu Mullu,"Aiyampettai Arivudainambi Kaliyaperumal Chandran is a graduate in search of his first job. He and his sister Uma have no relatives or acquaintances except their doctor/family friend. The doctor advises him to attend an interview for a job at his friend Sriramachandramurthy's import-export company, Sarojini Traders. Sriramachandramurthy is a man of traditional values. He hates youths wearing modern clothes. He is a sports fan but thinks lowly of youths knowing anything about sports. He dislikes men without moustaches as he believes such men are characterless.
Chandran has a moustache; the doctor advises Chandran to take care of the other problems by acting in a manner Sriramachandramurthy appreciates: namely wearing a Nehru jacket for a usual dress given the poverty in the country, always telling his name in full, giving importance to his moustache, behaving decently, showing a lack of interest in sports and drama considering that they do not promote any wellbeing to the home or the country, respecting one's parents, and detesting the concept of having someone else recommend a person for jobs instead of recommending for oneself. He impresses Sriramachandramurthy who hires him immediately.
One day, Chandran takes leave by pretending that his mother, who actually died many years ago, has taken ill and goes to watch a football match. Sriramachandramurthy, who attends the match as well, sees him there. The next day, Sriramachandramurthy queries Chandran about what he witnessed. To escape from the ire of his boss and being fired from his first job, he decides to lie. Remembering the plot of a film his friend, actor Nagesh is shooting, Chandran convinces Sriramachandramurthy that he had seen his moustache-less identical twin Indran at the stadium. Sriramachandramurthy buys his argument and feels bad about accusing him. He makes amends by hiring ""Indran"" to teach his daughter Sarojini music.
Chandran is forced to lead a dual life: as a sincere hardworking employee under his real name, and as Sarojini's music teacher Indran; subsequently, Sarojini and ""Indran"" fall in love. Things take an unexpected turn when Sriramachandramurthy asks Chandran to meet his mother. Chandran, with Nagesh's help, requests a wealthy socialite, Meenakshi Duraiswamy, to pose as Chandran's widowed mother. Chandran ultimately tells Sarojini the truth. Sarojini tells him to tell Sriramachandramurthy as well. Chandran goes to Sriramachandramurthy, but Sriramachandramurthy sees Chandran's false moustache, giving away the secret. Sriramachandramurthy exposes Chandran but ends up thinking that Indran murdered Chandran and impersonated him to marry Sarojini. He then chases Chandran, whom he thinks is Indran, across the city via car to kill him. Due to his rash driving, he seemingly cripples Uma during the chase.
Sriramachandramurthy is sued by lawyer Charuhasan on Chandran's behalf for injuring Uma. Sriramachandramurthy is, for the most part, scared during the lawyer's monologue, but eventually realises that he is being fooled again — this time by Charuhasan, who is actually an actor hired by Chandran, while Uma was not actually crippled in the chase. At this point, all the main characters approach Sriramachandramurthy and tell him the truth. A visibly confused and shaken Sriramachandramurthy locks himself in a room, and comes out with his moustache shaved off, feeling that he does not need something which caused so much trouble. Sriramachandramurthy then laments to a picture of Muruga about his foolishness. As he does so, the picture of Muruga changes into that of Ganesha; the voice of Ganesha apologises to him as he was also involved in fooling him."

She wants him to wish for her birthday on the following Tuesday and she will not tell him that she is going to Dubai. Pasupathy tries to get information from Janani's grandmother. He goes to Sivagurunthan and tells Gangulee has gone to Dubai which angers Sivagurunathan as he doubts that GanguLee has gone to impress his daughter.

Sarathi goes into a dark place and is blocked by two guys. Sarathi takes out his gun and tries to shoot them. Krishna, who has been watching this, pounces on Sarathi and saves the two guys, Sagaa and Dharman. Dharma kills Sarathi and thanks Krishna, and they become friends.
A flashback reveals Krishna's story. He has a family, and his sister wants to become a doctor. Despite getting good marks in her +2 exams, she is unable to secure a seat in the Govt. Medical College. Because of this, Krishna decides to admit her in a private college. He somehow manages to find a seat with help from some middlemen and pays around 60 lakhs for that. Soon, he learns that the college has been denied NCA approval, and the students who got admitted there are now helpless. When Krishna enquires in the college, he gets a reply that he paid the capitation to middlemen and should contact them further. Sarathi happens to be the middleman, and he attacks Krishna when he asks for the money. Krishna then files a police complaint with the help of his fiancée Janani, who is a sub-inspector.
Meanwhile, a youngster is robbed off his money and car by a group of thieves at night, and he is Gourav, who is the rich son of Gupta, an industrialist and the owner of the medical college. The thief ties Gourav almost naked to a pole and takes away his BMW. Gourav is rescued in the morning by an ongoer and vows to take revenge against the thief.
The affected students now start their protests, and suddenly, Krishna's sister is killed in what appears to be an accident. Krishna vows to take revenge against the killers, whom he believes to be the owner of the college, Gourav, but he controls his anger. He decides to help the students and plans to get his revenge slowly.
Meanwhile, Gourav's BMW is found, and the thief is revealed to be Dharman. Gourav's men track Dharman, and they capture him and take him to Gourav, who wants him killed. However, Dharman attacks the driver and slams the car onto Krishna's sister, thus killing her. Dharman escapes and vows to take revenge against Gourav. Hearing this story from Dharman, Krishna too reveals to Dharman that his second target is Gourav, and they both decide to help each other and kill Gourav. However, Krishna silently plots his revenge against Dharman too, who happened to kill his sister in the accident.
Krishna threatens Gourav's assistant Karna and gets important details regarding the capitation fee and uses this as a bait against Gourav. Gourav is searching for the guy who is the reason behind this, and he is unable to find him. Krishna and Dharman plan to lure Gourav into a trap and kill him. They plan that Dharman will inform Gourav about Krishna and his plans and will make him come to a place with cash, in exchange for Krishna. However, Gourav asks Dharman to kill Krishna and take the money. Dharman backstabs Krishna and attacks him. Gourav uses this to kill Sagaa with a gun and hurt Dharman. Krishna manages to fight off Gourav and gain control. When he is about to kill him, the students come in and request Krishna not to kill Gourav, as they all wanted to become doctors and they do not want to kill someone to get back their money. Krishna insults Gourav that he is worse than Dharman, who will do anything for money, but even after being so rich, Gourav is doing dirty things to get more money, which makes him nothing more than a scumbag. Gourav is touched by this and feels guilty. As Krishna and the students leave the place, a gunshot is heard and the film ends, implying that Gourav has shot himself."
1577,Zindagi Jalebi,"Zindagi Jalebi  is a comedy based on the idea that idle minds are the devil's workshop. It also symbolises an innate need and tendency of every human to do a heroic deed and a desire to be remembered for it for times to come. If their ordinary lives and circumstances do not have a place for a heroic deed, then they want to manipulate and create one. The comedy is that those who set out for the task end up creating a hero out of somebody else and somehow come out of the series of events unscathed. Zindagi Jalebi is a story where everyone's life is jumbling up in a mess and then how they come out of this mess."

Hearing his shout, the other 2 boys along with Molu rush there and pull him out. Molu realizes that Ravi has drowned and Alosius confirms the same. They try in vain to find Ravi in the swamp. Thomas threatens to kill Molu if she tells anyone about this incident. Molu informs them that she also feels responsible for what's happened and wouldn't inform anyone. She returns to the hotel. The boys wait for the evening, when Christmas celebrations start, to return to the hotel so that no one would notice that Ravi is missing. At night Madhavan brings them their drink which they had ordered the previous day. After Madhavan leaves Thomas asks the boys to have their drinks but they refuse. They accuse him of being hard hearted and of being responsible for the death of Ravi. Thomas throws the bottle through the window and walks out to the balcony to find Molu standing next door.

1600,Kalloori,"The film begins with a group of students clearing weeds near a roadside tree.
The scene flashes back a few years earlier in a bus with a lot of college students heading towards Government Arts College in a small town. A set of people – Muthuchelvan, Ramesh, Kayalvizhi, Adhilakshmi, Nagarani, Albert, Kamakshinathan, Salima, Ayyanar – are introduced as friends since high school. Muthu is a well-talented athlete. Ramesh is a big flirt and movie buff. Kayal is a strong-willed and courageous woman who hates the idea of falling in love within friends. Adhilakshmi is a food lover. Nagarani is a Telugu-speaking girl who gets fits when she is frightened. Albert is a Christian who always gets abused by his drunkard father. Kamakshinathan is a rich yet timid person who gets very shy to introduce himself to his classmates at the first day of college. Salima is a Muslim girl who is both intelligent in studies and talented in dance. Ayyanar is a quirky guy. All are studying in the same class. They enter into the college for the first time. In the classroom, they see a beautiful girl named Shobhana, who is strikingly different. She looks depressed and aloof. The friends are puzzled by her in the beginning, and they later learn that she recently lost her mother in an accident. The group sympathizes for her and brings her into their fold. Shobhana soon becomes a member of their group and ditches her plans to pursue her course in Delhi simply to be with these friends during college.
The movie goes on to narrate the college life with fun and colour. It shows the strength of the friendship and the backgrounds of the friends; most of them are from poor families. Muthu has an aim in his life. Being an athlete, he wants to excel in sports and get a good job through the sports quota to give his poor family a new lease of life. Shobhana, who is from a wealthy family background, feels sympathy for Muthu after she sees the conditions that he and his family live in. She is moved by his perseverance and helps him achieve his goal by encouraging him in every chance. She even advises him that there is more he has to do and be capable of achieving in life, so he should take her encouragements as a way to improve his career and nothing else. But eventually, her encouraging stance turns into some sort of special attachment with him. Slowly, love develops in the minds of both, but they chose to put it on the back seat for the sake of the larger friendship that they share with the group.
Eventually, the friends take a college trip to Andhra. On the way, they stop at a hotel, but there is only non-vegetarian food being served, so Muthu volunteers to run to the nearest vegetarian restaurant a few kilometers away to bring food for Shobhana, who is a vegetarian. Shobhana confessed her love for Muthu to Kayal, which she accepts it wholeheartedly and says that even though she hates the concept of love between best friends, she does not want to spoil Shobhana's happiness and true love. This conversation was overheard by Adhilakshmi. The latter says this to the rest of the gang, to their surprise and delight. Unfortunately, fate has other plans. The hotel they were initially eating at is urgently closed because some politician or another has been arrested.  The group boards the bus urgently and tries to go to a collector's office or police station to keep safe while two classmates wait for Muthu to come back. On the way, however, the bus is stopped by the protestors, and despite pleas to allow them to pass, the protestors light the bus on fire. In a frenzy, everyone tries to evacuate the bus, and Nagarani gets fits. In a scramble to safely get off the bus, the rest of the group fail to realize that some students are still trapped. After the firefighters finish putting out the fire, they bring out the burnt bodies of Kayal, Adhilakshmi and Shobhana, who have embraced each other in their final moments together – Kayal having stayed back to help Shobhana, whose chudi had gotten caught in the bus.
The last scene flashes back to the beginning of the movie, where the group of people were clearing the weeds. It has been eight years since the incident, and every year, the group of friends come to pay respects to their lost friends, and Muthu still keeps  Shobhana's handkerchief in remembrance of their love."

Colonel Damle briefs the officers on the latest situation and reveals that a number of infiltrators have crossed the Line of Control (LoC) from Pakistan and currently occupy a series of mountain peaks on the Indian side of the border. The battalion has been assigned to secure Point 5179, a crucial vantage point dominating the army's main supply line, the National Highway 1D. The northern side of the mountain is on the Pakistani side of the LoC, the western side has a 1000-foot vertical rock cliff and the southern side has 3 km of empty ground with no cover.

However, Karan remains reluctant to return her feelings as he is still under the impression that she's engaged. In the second phase of the assault, the battalion attacks the peak of the mountain but fails to capture it due to the strategic advantage and heavy weaponry the Pakistanis have. The unit suffers heavy casualties. Brigadier Puri summons Colonel Damle and gives him 48 hours to capture the peak – after that time period, responsibility for Point 5179 will be given to another battalion. Colonel Damle then orders a group of 12 officers and soldiers (including Karan) to scale the 1000-foot rock cliff on the western side of the mountain and flank the enemy stronghold. They will be provided with artillery support from the eastern side. Karan realises that he has finally found his goal in the form of capturing the peak. Karan also learns of Romi's failed engagement and expresses his feelings for her. Romi promises Karan she will wait for him whether he returns or not. The unit sets off on their mission and while moving through a grass field toward the rock cliff, they come under fire. The unit discovers a Pakistani mortar unit in the field and destroys it, but loses their commanding officer and a number of other soldiers. The team's radios are also destroyed, so they cannot communicate with battalion HQ. Out of the initial 12, only 6 remain. They decide to continue with the mission. They successfully scale the cliff and attack the Pakistani position during the night. Their assault is successful although Karan is wounded, and the team loses 3 more men. The next morning, Karan limps to the peak, where he plants the Indian flag and fires a flare, signalling to Colonel Damle and Subedar Major Pritam Singh that they captured the peak. Days later, Karan is shown leaving a military hospital and reuniting with his parents and Romi who asks him that what is his next aim after attaining his first one.

Despite these rules, three Gurukul students—Sameer, Vicky, and Karan—fall in love.

He sympathizes with the predicaments of Sameer, Vicky, and Karan, and encourages them to persist and stay loyal to their loves.

One day, as part of his plan, Raj throws a party, to which he invites the students of the all-girls college. Narayan discovers the party and threatens to dismiss Raj. At this point, Raj reveals he had been a student at Gurukul over a decade earlier and that he had fallen in love with Megha, Narayan's only daughter.

The student body, however, encouraged by Raj, continues to defy the rules and in a final effort to preserve the school atmosphere he has built up for 25 years, Narayan expels the three students. Raj speaks up on their behalf, stating they did nothing wrong by falling in love and accusing Narayan of causing his own daughter's death with his intolerance of love. Raj also says he feels Narayan lost the challenge because his daughter left him and now Raj, who considered Narayan an elder, is leaving him as well. Raj's words hurt Narayan, who realizes his strict no-romance policy is misguided. Narayan apologizes to the student body, resigns as principal of Gurukul, and nominates Raj as his successor.

Before they can inform Paramashiva Rao, they are killed by two cops, who are joined by I.G. Shankar Ramdas.

A tainted spiritual figure with deeply entrenched connections with prominent politicians in Delhi and even possessing the clout to influence the judiciary, Chandramoulishwar is the disciple of yesteryear Godman Swami Amoorthananda - who had a predominant drug cartel functioning within his ashram. However, Swami Chandramoulishwar is able to suffocate him before pushing him into the Yamuna river. The next day, the bodies of Kishore, Dr. Sudarshan, and Dr. Emma are all found in the riverside. Since both the doctors are seen in an intimate position, the police conclude that Kishore killed the two out of jealousy, and then killed himself right after by drowning himself into the river.

1619,Ra.One,"In 2010, London, Jenny Nair, an employee of UK-based company Barron Industries, introduces a new technology that allows objects from the digital world to enter the real world using the wireless transmissions from multiple devices. Shekhar Subramanium, who also works for the company, is given a final chance to devise with a video game with a difference. To impress his sceptical son Prateek, and upon the request of his wife Sonia, Subramanium uses his son's idea that the antagonist be more powerful than the protagonist.
Shekhar's colleague Akashi provides the moves of the game's characters, Jenny does the programming and Shekhar gives his face to the game's protagonist G.One, whilst the antagonist Ra.One is faceless and has substantially greater powers than those granted to G.One, including shapeshifting. Ra.One is imbibed with a self-learning artificial intelligence. The game has three levels, and either of the players can only be killed in the third level using a special gun that holds a single bullet. While designing the game, Akashi notices some malfunctions but ignores them. When the game is finally launched, it receives a standing ovation and Prateek loves it so much that he insists on playing it instantly. He logs in under the alias 'Lucifer' and proceeds to the second level, but is interrupted by Akashi. The self-aware Ra.One, being unable to end his turn with Lucifer, becomes determined that Lucifer shall die.
When the mainframe fails to shut down, Akashi calls Shekhar, who notices a problem with the game. Ra.One uses the new technology to enter the real world and breaks free and goes to find Lucifer.
Ra One first threatens Akashi and asks him where Lucifer is. When Akashi fails to reply, Ra One thinks that he is useless and abruptly abducts and wastes Akashi by knocking him off a large glass window that frightens Shekhar and mercilessly plummets and murders weak Akashi.
Shekhar comes back to find a dead Akashi bleeding and horribly hanging on live electric wires and Ra One recharging. Shekhar rushes home but is blocked by Ra.One on the way. In an attempt to save his son, Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer. However, Ra.One scans Shekhar's I.D. and kills him for lying. Prateek notices the strange circumstances of his father's death and realises that Ra.One has come to life. He and Jenny attempt to bring G.One to life. Meanwhile, Sonia tells Prateek that the family will return to India. Having taken the form of Akashi, Ra.One chases them, but G.One enters the real world through Jenny's computer and causes a gas explosion which saves them and temporarily destroys Ra.One. G.One takes Ra.One's H.A.R.T., without which Ra.One is not powerful. Sonia finds she cannot leave G.One and takes him along with them to India through Shekhar's passport. G.One promises Sonia that he will protect Prateek from any harm. Ra.One returns to life, takes the form of a billboard model, and tracks G.One and Prateek.
During Prateek's birthday party, Ra.One hypnotises Sonia, assumes her form and kidnaps Prateek. Ra.One then instructs G.One to give him his H.A.R.T. back, and sends the real Sonia in an uncontrollable Mumbai Suburban Railway train. G.One saves Sonia just in the nick of time (though the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus is destroyed) and returns to save Prateek. The game resumes, with Prateek controlling G.One's moves. Following a lengthy fight, both of the characters reach the third level. With little power left, G.One and Prateek trick Ra.One into shooting G.One without his H.A.R.T. attached, which leaves Ra.One helpless. Furious, Ra.One creates ten copies of himself. Prateek, unable to differentiate the real Ra.One, asks G.One to quote one of Shekhar's sayings: ""If you join the forces of evil, its shadows shall always follow you"". The pair then realise that only one of the ten Ra.Ones has a shadow: the original one. G.One shoots and destroys him, and after absorbing Ra.One's remains, transports himself back into the digital world.
Several months later, Prateek and Sonia return to the UK, where Prateek finally manages to restore G.One to the real world, much to his and his mother's joy."

1621,Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain,"In 1984, a few months before the Bhopal disaster, Dilip (Rajpal Yadav), a rickshaw driver, loses his income when his rickshaw breaks down while transporting an employee to the Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal. Dilip lives in the slums near the plant with his wife, a son and his sister. He obtains a job in the plant as a labourer, and is happy since his daily wage is restored.
The plant's revenues drop due to lower sales of pesticides, and in order to reduce costs the officials neglect safety and maintenance. Questioning the chemicals used in the plant, Motwani (Kal Penn), a tabloid reporter, publishes reports on his printing press which are disregarded by most of the officials and workers. Roy (Joy Sengupta), the plant safety officer, expresses his concerns. The officials however ignore his warnings, and a worker is killed when a drop of methyl isocyanate leaking from a pipe lands on his arm. The officials deem the worker's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident and the plant continues to function. Dilip is given a better-paying vacant job in the plant despite lacking the skill to operate the machinery. A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with methyl isocyanate, and in an attempt to stop people from panicking, the official in the plant disables the warning siren.
Warren Anderson (Martin Sheen), the CEO of Union Carbide, visits the plant to inspect its functionality, where he is briefed about a plan to connect two additional tanks for storage of methyl isocyanate to increase the output of the plant, ignoring the deteriorated condition of the tanks. Motwani meanwhile meets Eva Gascon (Mischa Barton), a reporter for Paris Match, and persuades her to interview Anderson. She falsely claims to be an Associated Press reporter, but her lie is exposed during the interview. Motwani convinces Dilip of the danger posed by the chemicals.
As the date of the disaster nears, Dilip arranges a loan for his sister's wedding. Roy later explains how the company is ignoring safety standards and that a future leak might become uncontrolled as the officials had turned off safety measures to reduce maintenance costs. Roy gives his resignation to the company and advises Dilip not to talk about the plant's safety if he wishes to retain his job. Dilip makes a phone call to Motwani describing what Roy just said, and expresses his fear about the plant's safety, saying he will return to the rickshaw-pulling business as soon as his sister is married.
To overcome the increasing revenue loss, the officials shut down the plant, firing most of the workers, including Dilip. The plant officials then order the use of the remaining methyl isocyanate as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Dilip is busy with his sister's wedding, and Roy has a final look of the control room. The safety measures fail and a runaway reaction follows. The faulty tanks cause the gas to start leaking, and an attempt to contain the leak fails. The gas escapes to the surroundings and is carried east by the wind. Motwani rushes to alert the people in the vicinity of the plant to vacate and head west, since the warning sirens were previously sabotaged. He meets Dilip, who ignores the warning and asks Motwani to leave the area without causing any hindrance to the wedding. Meanwhile, the guests experience irritation in the eyes and discomfort in breathing. Dilip senses the danger and visits the plant, realising that the plant had been compromised. He rushes back to his residence where he finds his family and relatives dying from acute exposure to the toxic gas. He carries away his son, paying farewell to his wife's corpse and flees the slum.
As the gas shows its effects, a nearby hospital is filled with hundreds of patients reporting cyanide poisoning, and the lack of antidote results in most of the patients' death. Dilip, on his deathbed, and using the last of his strength, rips off his Union Carbide identity badge and after flinging it away, rests his dead son on the ground. He eventually accepts his fate to die in the highly toxic gas cloud and succumbs to the toxic gas, dying by his son's side. The story jumps to the present day, where a blind boy is holding Dilip's identity badge, and the film ends with Motwani narrating the words, ""Whatever may be the cause of the disaster, Carbide never left Bhopal."" A photo montage depicts the aftermath of the disaster and pictures of the characters and their real-life counterparts."

She returns to her hometown Shamli with Radha, to find that he has already died and left her the responsibility of saving the deserted dance theatre, Ajanta, which is to be demolished to make way for a shopping centre.
Shamli has changed a great deal since Dia left. Her parents left the town in shame a decade ago, after she eloped with an American photographer Steve, (later they divorced) and their house is now owned by the strict Mr. Chojar and his wife. Her childhood friend Najma (Divya Dutta) is married to Farooque (Irrfan Khan), a successful businessman. Both of them greet Dia coldly. The only ally she has left is her old friend Doctor Saab (Raghubir Yadav). To save Ajanta, Dia goes to petition the local MP Raja Uday Singh (Akshaye Khanna). He issues her a challenge; if she can put on a successful performance using only people from Shamli, he will cancel the demolition.
That night Dia dances in Ajanta and afterward calls on the people to help her put up a performance of the famous Laila-Majnu play. Jeering at her, they leave the theatre one by one, but Raja remains behind, reminding her of the challenge. Refusing to accept defeat, Dia goes out into the street the next day to scout for talent. When she returns to the theatre she finds that a group of thugs is burning the set, after being ordered by a local election candidate, Chaudhary Om Singh. Instead of being angry, she is intrigued by the ring-leader, Imran (Kunal Kapoor), and makes a deal with Chaudhary – she will help him win the next election, if he will support Ajanta and if Imran plays Majnu. He agrees and Imran is forced to take on the role. After finding out about the casting of Imran, many girls flock to the theatre for the part of Laila. Among them is Anokhi (Konkona Sen), a tomboy who is in love with Imran. She begs Dia, who is reluctant because of her rough appearance and lack of talent but agrees in the end, thinking that her love for Imran will make her the ideal Laila.

With one month to put the show together, Dia struggles to get Imran and Anokhi to work together. With Dia's support, Anokhi changes her attitude and appearance to get Imran to take her seriously and soon their relationship deepens. A few days before the show, Farooque pays Chaudhary to abandon Ajanta and makes Najma spread hurtful stories about Dia. Chaudhary tries to get Imran to give up his part, but Imran is aware of Chaudhary's political intentions and refuses, leading him to be attacked by Chaudhary's men while Anokhi tries to protect him, making Imran fall in love with her. With the whole town against her, Dia loses hope until Najma arrives to apologise and asks to be in the show.
On the night of the show, Uday asks the inspector (who later gets roped in to play Laila's father) to make sure that whoever wants to attend the program should not face any obstacles in reaching the venue. Dia is amazed to find that the entire town has come to Ajanta. The troupe put on a performance that amazes and excites the audience, including Chaudhary who is moved to tears. Farooque is stunned to see his wife playing the part of Laila's mother and Mrs. Chojar is shocked and thrilled when her husband appears singing and dancing on stage. In the end, the audience cheers loudly as the cast return to the stage for an encore. The night is a success and Ajanta is saved. Imran and Anokhi become a couple.

However, Radha hands over Dia's New York number to Uday, to which Dia does not seem to mind very much and he seems very happy to receive. Afterwards, Dia says her farewells to Shamli, and she and Radha leave to find her parents in another part of India. Imran and Anokhi go on to teach dance classes at Ajanta with Doctor Saab's help and dance becomes an inherent part of Shamli once again. Later it is shown that Raja Uday visits Dia in New York and is seen watching her dance. They smile at each other and he hands her a cup of coffee, implying that they will develop a romance."
1634,ABCD 2,"Suresh 'Suru' Mukund, a waiter in a bar, wants to be a big dancer to fulfill his late mother Durgadevi's wish, for which he is supported by his best friend Vernon Monteiro, a pizza delivery boy. Vinita ""Vinnie"" Sharma, a hairdresser, wants to be the best hip-hop dancer. Childhood friends from suburban Nalasopara, Mumbai, they form a team and participate in a national-level competition Hum Kisi Se Kum Nahin where they are disqualified from the grand finale as their moves are revealed to be copied from the performance act of the Philippine All Stars and the judges term them ""cheaters"". Everyone departs to search for jobs. Suru returns to work as a waiter, Vinnie rejoins a beauty parlor and Vernon gets back as a delivery boy where, on and off, they are insulted as cheaters. The departure of angry teammates adds injury to insult, and nothing is set to be corrected.
Suru hopes to remove the negative tag by planning to win a grander hip-hop competition in Las Vegas, the World Dance Championship, where the Philippine All Stars are highly popular. One day he watches Vishnu, a rogue visitor, prove his dance mettle to a betting visitor in the bar and convinces him repeatedly to be their choreographer. They audition for people and formulate the team. During the practices for the qualifiers, Vinod, a deaf-mute dancer, discovers Vinnie and Suru's hidden love for each other. They visit the qualifiers in Bangalore, where they are pre-insulted as cheaters, but manage to win it after Vishnu begs the audience for one last chance for the team. Although things are fine, Suru is broken when Shetty Anna, the owner of the bar where he is employed, refuses to provide him financial support extending to Rs. 25 lakhs, something he had earlier publicly promised to Suru at the time of the Hum Kisi Se Kum Nahin finale, and Suru leaves the place, angry at Anna's insulting language for Vinnie. However, Vishnu manages to get the money from Crocxz's uncle who he convinces after Suru loses hope when Vishnu gets angry at his inability to arrange team funds. Later they prepare to go to Las Vegas, but Vinod learns from Vishnu himself that the latter has ulterior motives to go to Vegas, and, as a matter of fact, he had deliberately impressed Suru and friends to procure a way out for his plan. After reaching Las Vegas, they win the qualifiers. Later, Vishnu leaves the hotel with team money to meet his son Manu, whose mother Swati, Vishnu's ex-wife, is married to another man and has moved on in life. His son Manu recognizes him, his art, and his achievements, and Vishnu leaves with a contented heart.
Meanwhile, Vinnie is injured due to excessive rehearsal and is replaced by Olive, an American girl of partial Indian origin, and Vishnu discovers this while thanking friend Gopi, who works in a bar-cum-hotel. At the same time, Suru is enraged when he finds Vishnu missing and tries to proceed with jam sessions all on his own, but in vain. Vishnu returns while trying to save the day for Suru from the German team as they get into a fight, later admitting he had made a 'mistake' leaving without permission although he didn't want to lose a family he had yearned to create in years; he apologizes, is forgiven by Suru, and the team enters the finals. Across rehearsals, Olive gets close to Suru, and a jealous Vinnie finally confronts Suru, who initially finds it difficult to confess his love for her as they had been best friends from childhood, but eventually gets together with her. Although Olive has feelings for Suru, an in-person conversation with Vinnie assures Olive that Suru had that inherent charm with nothing to do about his sweetness, and Olive agrees to continue with the Indian Stunners after Vinnie recovers. The team enters the final, where Vinod's health worsens during an ""assemblage"" by the team, and the formation suddenly breaks down even as his friend D, who knew about his tuberculosis problem, tries to support him.

Although unable to win the competition, they win the hearts of millions, with Suru lending a voiceover narrative about his mother's motivational lessons on dance."
1635,ABCD: Any Body Can Dance,"After having a bitter disagreement with his friend and manager Jehangir Khan about the latter's blatant abuse of power and influence to win a dance competition called ""Dance Dil Se"" for his team JDC (Jehangir Dance Company), the choreographer of the dance company, Vishnu, quits his job. At first he wants to return home to Chennai, but his friend Gopi asks him to stay in Mumbai with him. Vishnu observes several young men using parkour to evade the police. They turn out to be proteges of Gopi, but despite their obvious raw talent, they lack the discipline required to become serious artists; they demonstrate this disastrously at a local event for a politician, wherein they set the stage on fire. After witnessing the youngsters showing their dancing abilities at Ganpati Chaturthi against their equally talented rival neighborhood, Vishnu decides to start his own dance group with them ultimately preparing them to compete in ""Dance Dil Se"". However, the lack of discipline among the dancers and rivalry between the two factions in the group led by D (Dharmesh Yelande) and Rocky (Salman Yusuff Khan) leads to multiple creative and emotional blocks. Initially, only Rocky and his gang are willing to attend the free classes, but soon D and his friends gravitate towards the studio.
They are soon joined by Chandu, a troubled but extraordinarily talented man suffering from a drug addiction, Shaina, a ""bar dancer"", and Rhea, a Westerner who was JDC's star dancer until Jehangir tried to sexually assault her during a ""private instruction"". Rhea immediately becomes the new star of the group. Though the students are initially skeptical of Shaina because of her profession, Chandu demonstrates a great deal of respect for Shaina and defends her in front of the class despite teasing from his peers. The pair quickly fall for one another, leaving quite a few of the boys heartbroken.
Despite repeated pleas for peace in the studio, the two main gangs continue to clash, driving Vishnu to his wit's end. However, the students seem to improve and as a reward, he gives them money to buy new speakers, but they nearly lose it all when Rhea takes them to an elite dance club where they challenge the resident champions, a professional dance crew called ""Fictitious Crew"". Vishnu arrives at the last minute and wins back the money, but while his students gain new respect for him he is furious with them. After some hard apologizing, he forgives them and they return to class with greater discipline and drive, only to suddenly be thrown out on the street after D's father calls the cops. During all of this Rocky and Rhea start to fall for each other whilst D burns with jealousy.
The crew head to Dance Dil Se and audition, but when Rocky and D fight onstage for Rhea, their chances of appearing on the show in the first place seems bleak. Jehangir, in a bid to humiliate Vishnu publicly, persuades the judges to take the ""Dhongri Dance Revolution"" crew on as the shows ""jokers"". Faced with ridicule and the idea that they are a joke and not true dancers, Vishnu asks Rocky and D to do a step that requires a great deal of trust from both, but they cannot muster the trust to manage it. Vishnu has them choose the people they would trust to perform the step with, but then tricks both dancers by blindfolding them and having them attempt it again; this time, they are successful. Vishnu then states that unless the two manage to do the step without blindfolds none of the dancers would be allowed to go home for the night. Several abortive and unsuccessful attempts later D and Rocky take a break and Chandu talks to D and tells him about Bhavana's secret love for D. Bhavana and D get together, D completes the move successfully with Rocky, and the two factions begin to trust each other and work together. They even perform a dance act full of comedy dressed as jokers to answer back Jehangir's comment. The community complains that their children should not be mixing in such a way and through an impromptu dance performance are the youth able to convince their families about the importance of their talent. However, D's conservative and orthodox father refused to accept that his son desires to be a dancer.
Before the semi-finals, Chandu prepares to propose to Shaina, but he meets his old drug dealer on the street. Now completely free from the hold of drugs he refuses to fall back into that world, but the dealer, irritated, tosses the ring intended for Shaina at him and it falls into the street. As he retrieves it, Chandu is hit by a truck and killed, leaving the team devastated. Shaina, though barely able to stand from grief, becomes the centrepiece of the team's semi-final routine, in which they express the loss of their friend, bringing audience members to tears. The team and the community come together to cremate Chandu, and DDR resolves to continue in the competition in Chandu's memory. At the finals, Jehangir pulls a dirty trick: his informant Mayur (a performer in DDR but, tempted by Jehangir's offer of a main lead role in JDC began to feed information to the opposition) leads JDC's dancers to copy DDR's choreography and performance concept. Faced with losing, DDR crafts a new routine on the spot, based around Lord Ganesha. Their heartfelt and spontaneous performance reminds the cold-hearted Jehangir of his old friendship with Vishnu and why they started JDC in the first place and he is humbled. The DDR crew are rewarded with thunderous applause and victory in the competition."
1636,Agathiyar,"The story is about Agathiyar Muni, who is considered to be the embodiment of one of celestial intellectuals who descended on earth to enlighten human beings. During the wedding of Shiva and Goddess Parvati, the earth tilted to the northern side, as the whole world was witnessing the marriage. Shiva gave the responsibility of balancing the earth to Agathiyar by going to the southern side. Agathiyar is also given the additional responsibility of spreading goodness and equality. He has the additional task of spreading the Tamil language. Many small stories between heaven and earth are interwoven in the movie. The stories teach one to lead a simple existence without ego. It also shows how Agathiyar in this journey destroyed the ego of River Kaveri, Vindhya Mount and Ravana, thereby teaching them the greatness of humility.
Agathiyar travels southwards, while there, River Ponni talks to Agathiyar egotistically and argues with him. Finally, Agathiyar loses his temper and traps river Ponni in his Kamandalam, and sat down to meditate. Lord Vinayagar (Lord Ganesha) in the form of a crow, pushes Agathiyar Kamandalam down, thus rescuing and leading the river into its formation. Then Agathiyar named the River Ponni as River Kaveri (Crow) (In Tamil (Kakam), pushed Kamandalam and the water flows to broadly (In Tamil Virinthu Odiyathal) named as Ka + viri= Kaviri (became Kaveri in later usage).
One time Mount Vidhayan was continually growing in size due to taunting comments by Sage Narathar (Narada). So as to temper the vanity of the mountains, Sage Agathiyar travelled to the southern side via mount Vindhyan. On their way when Vindhyan saw Agathiyar, he bowed with respect and reverence, upon which sage Agathiyar jokingly asked if he would stay bowed and subdued with respect till the sage returned. Mount Vindhyan was truly benevolent and promised to not grow until the sage returns from the south. However, after passing through the mount, the sage will not require again to cross over to the northern side of Mount Vindhyan.
Narathar was speaking proudly to others. He is most reverent to Vishnu (Lord Narayana) because he always thinks and chants about only Vishnu. Agathiyar tells Narathar to watch one day for a potter. Narathar also does that and tells Agathiyar that the potter man chants about ""Narayana"" twice daily. Then, Agathiyar kept Narathar a small bowl full of oil in Narathar's hands. Agathiyar gives a rule asking Narathar to not spill one drop of oil while going around the world, and Narada does the job perfectly. Agathiyar then questions Narathar, ""how many times did you chant ""Narayana""'s name today?"" for which Narathar answered saying ""how can I even think of revering my name, when I have a burden kept in my hands?"". Agathiyar explains to Narathar, that he has one smallest burden, but even while doing that you forgot to chant your name. But that man has much troubles in his family and many burdens. But he still remembered and chanted Vishnu's name, which makes him the best devotee of Vishnu.
Ravana was in a Yazh competition with Agathiyar Muni, because of taunting comments by the Narathar Muni. But who shall be the competition's referee? Ravana called Goddess Saraswati, but Saraswati told them, we both her eyes. So, she leaves them. Then only Ravan select for ""Ponmalai"" because stones only not melting to anything. both are composing the instrument Yazh who turn composing the Yazh when the mount started to melt, they won the competition. Unfortunately, Ravana loses the competition and then Agathiyar was given new name to ""ponmalai"", it named by Pothigai Malai (meaning it was give judgement for constant (or) the judgement is impartial).
It is said that two demon brothers Ilavala and Vathapi used to kill Brahmins as a revenge in a simple manner. The two had special powers, they came up with a plan to take revenge on Brahmins. ""Vatapi"" would turn in to ripe mango. He would invite any passers-by, especially Brahmins for a grand feast at his home. After they eat the mango, Ilavala would call his brother out: ""Vathapi"" , his brother would respond from the belly of the visitor and come out alive in one piece. In the process the guest would be killed. The two demons later would enjoy a curry made of human flesh. One day, Agathiyar happened to pass by, the plan as usual, Vatapi changed into a ripe mango and the other disguised himself as brahmachari (Sage of Bachelor) who invited Agathiyar to eat at the home. Agathiyar knew about the plan due to his immense Vedic Power, he resolves to teach both a lesson. After the meal, Agathiyar simply rubbed his stomach saying ""Vathapi Jeerano bhave"" may Vathapi be digested, while other demon tries to bring his brother life, but in vain. Agathiyar plainly informed the demon that his brother has been digested and could no longer be brought back to life, bringing their treachery to an end."

Charlie finds that diamonds  worth 300 crore ($39.48 million) will reach the Atlantis Hotel, Dubai on Christmas Eve. He wants to steal the same diamonds  and frame Grover. To accomplish this, he assembles a dynamic team consisting of Ex-Captain Jagmohan ""Jag"" Prakash, a hard-of-hearing strongman, Tehamton Tammilo ""Tammy"" Irani (Boman Irani), an old and seizure-prone safecracker and Manohar's best friend, Rohan Singh, a young intelligent hacker and Jag's nephew, and a lookalike of Charan's son Vicky Grover named Nandu Bhide.

The night of the final round, the heist is set in motion. Mohini lures Vicky into an elevator, where his thumbprint is copied on Nandu who opens the chamber. They open the crack but Charlie and Tammy find another glass safe which houses the diamonds that can open only by a 7-digit password. Tammy realizes that Manohar built this safe. Charlie opens the safe later after deep thought, realising that the password to open the safe was his own name. After stealing the diamonds, the team boards a boat, but Mohini refuses to come as she feels dedicated to protecting India's honor with the competition. Rohan joins her as well, leading to a fight amongst the remaining members.
When Team India is found missing, Grover claims that they are the thieves. As he watches Mohini perform, the other members also join her. Soon after, Charlie makes an appearance and eventually helps the team win the competition. With any and all suspicions removed from Team India, Charan and Vicky Grover are arrested.

The British come after Kadhambari, and in the end Francis is forced to kill her to save the literature. It turns out that after the guru discovered the story of Kadhambari, the MLA told him to keep it secret as the goddess legend attracted believers to the temple, and had engineered the guru's wife's death to silence it. The crowd is in awe with the story and they hail Sitara's performance. Finally, Sitara and her guru reconcile and the troupe prepares to leave for America."

While a highly accomplished artist in his field, Seshendra Sharma is not well-off and has not been able to afford for his daughters, a conventional education. Both of them have achieved a respectable degree of proficiency — Savitri in Carnatic classical music and Meenakshi in classical dance.
Savitri, the elder daughter, is grateful for her knowledge and interest and looks forward to a life that will require her to hone her skills in art. Meenakshi, on the other hand, is bitter about the lack of opportunity that she feels in the field of classical dance in India and resolves to make a simpler and more pleasurable life for herself as soon as possible while confiding her ambitions only to her sister.
Chandrasekhar (Venkatesh) is a tenant who has just moved in next door. He is a painter and is shown to be handling movie promotions as a large part of his work. He develops an interest in the neighbors and tries to help them in whatever way he can, partly because of his (unconfessed) interest in Meenakshi and partly because of his interest in the art which seems to be slowly fading from public life.
The rest of the film is largely built around Meenakshi's journey from skepticism to devotion in her pursuit of dance. Chandrasekhar is shown to be an important catalyst in this transformation. Meenakshi becomes an accomplished dancer through the direction of renowned Odissi dancer Sharon Lowen and gets the opportunity to go to the United States and perform.

1675,Thiruvilaiyadal,"The Hindu god Shiva gives a sacred mango fruit, brought by the sage Narada, to his elder son Vinayaka as a prize for outsmarting his younger brother Muruga in a competition. Angry with his father, Muruga (dressed as a hermit) goes to Palani. He meets Avvaiyar, one of his devotees, along the way. Despite her attempts to convince Muruga to return to Mount Kailash, he remains adamant about his decision to leave his family. His mother, the goddess Parvati, arrives there and tells the stories of four of Shiva's divine games to calm Muruga.
The first story is set in Madurai, the capital city of the Pandya Kingdom. Shenbagapandian, the king, wants to find the answer to a question posed by his wife (whether the fragrance of a woman's hair is natural or artificial), and announces a reward of 1,000 gold coins to anyone who can come up with the answer. Dharumi, a poor poet, desperately wants the reward, and starts to break down in the Meenakshi Amman Temple. Shiva, hearing him weeping, takes the form of a poet and gives Dharumi a poem containing the answer. Overjoyed, Dharumi takes the poem to Shenbagapandian's court and recites it; however, the court's head poet Nakkeerar claims that the poem's meaning is incorrect. On hearing this, Shiva argues with Nakkeerar about the poem's accuracy and burns him to ashes when he refuses to relent. Later, Shiva revives Nakkeerar and says that he only wanted to test his knowledge. Realising it was Shiva's will that Dharumi should get the reward, Nakkeerar requests Shenbagapandian to give it to Dharumi.
The second story focuses on Shiva marrying Sati against the will of her father, Daksha. Daksha performs a Mahayajna without inviting his son-in-law. Sati asks Shiva's permission to go to the ceremony, but Shiva refuses to let her go because he feels that no good will come from it. Sati disobeys him and goes, only to be insulted by Daksha. She curses her father and returns to Shiva, who is angry with her. Sati says that they are one; without her, there is no Shiva. He disagrees, and burns her to ashes. He then performs his Tandava, which is noticed by the Devas, who pacify him. Shiva restores Sati to life and Sati is reborn as Parvati and accepts their oneness.
In the third story, Parvati is banished by Shiva when she is momentarily distracted while listening to his explanation of the Vedas. Parvati, now born as Kayarkanni, is the daughter of a fisherman. When she is playing with her friends, Shiva approaches in the guise of a fisherman and tries to flirt with her. The fishermen are troubled by a giant shark who disrupts their way of life, and Shiva says that he alone can defeat the shark. After a long battle, Shiva subdues the shark (who is the bull deity Nandi in disguise) and marries Parvati.
The last story is about Banabathirar, a devotional singer. Hemanatha Bhagavathar, a talented singer, tries to conquer the Pandya Kingdom when he challenges its musicians. The king's minister advises the king to seek Banabathirar's help against Bhagavathar. When the other musicians spurn the competition, the king orders Banabathirar to compete against Bhagavathar. Knowing that he cannot win, the troubled Banabathirar prays to Shiva—who appears outside Bhagavathar's house in the form of a firewood vendor the night before the competition, and shatters his arrogance by singing ""Paattum Naane"". Shiva introduces himself to Bhagavathar as Banabathirar's student. Sheepish at hearing this, Bhagavathar leaves the kingdom immediately and leaves a letter for Shiva to give to Banabathirar. Shiva gives the letter to Banabathirar, and reveals his true identity; Banabathirar thanks him for his help.
After listening to the stories, Muruga realises that this too was one of Shiva's divine games to test his patience; he then reconciles with his family. The film ends with Avvaiyar singing ""Vaasi Vaasi"" and ""Ondraanavan Uruvil"", in praise of Shiva and Parvati."

Those were the days Dostoevsky fell in love with Anna Gregoryevna Snitkina, who was his new stenographer taking down his novel The Gambler. In heavy debt to his publisher, Dostoevsky was facing a deadline that carried a big penalty, to deliver the finished manuscript.
‘Like a Psalm’ describes with lyrical simplicity those 21 days of love and despair, imbuing the theme with empathy and emotional insight. Sreedharan's novel, now in its 61st edition and 21st year, continues to be a best-seller in Malayalam.
The film takes Sreedharan on his first ever visit to Russia and St. Petersburg, a country and a city he had imagined out of almost nothing, except for his reading in translation of the great Russian novelists, including Dostoevsky. His journey of discovery starts from his village in interior Kerala as he recalls how, as he wrote his novel, those 21 days of Dostoyevsky had entrapped him as if his life had caught fire and how he was entangled in Dostoevsky's traumatic and troubled personality. His memories of writing the novel, presented through brief face-to-face encounters and voice-overs, are supplemented by enacted moments that flash forward to the present, crystallizing the dynamics of recollection.
The film follows him in St. Petersburg as he explores a city he had once imagined from nothing, looking at its great landmarks, visiting Dostoevsky's home, sitting on Neva's shore, wandering in the country side. As he immerses himself in the city recollecting Dostoevsky and his intense creative engagement with him, visions and moments from his novel envelopes his present and he becomes an eye-witness to them.

Basharat belongs to a new generation of Kashmiris, having grown up under the shadow of a protracted conflict. His passion is football, and he has been coached by Juan Marcos Troia, an Argentinean national and FIFA accredited football coach by profession. Marcos aspires to breed world class players from Kashmir; he and his wife, being attached to both Basha and Kashmir, migrate to Srinagar with their three daughters to take up Basha's cause.Marcos runs a football academy called International Sports Academy Trust; and an exchange program for his most talented players to train at Santos FC, Pele's old club in Brazil. Basharat was one of chosen few, but was denied a passport by the Government of India. The passport in question did come through after Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah intervened.Inshallah, Football tells this story through Bashir's recollections and travails.  Kumar describes the film as ""the story of three remarkable men – one is his father who fought for his beliefs, another about the football coach who's come all the way from Argentina to start this football academy, and this young man who is struggling to play football.""The film has been critically acclaimed and played in competition part of the wide-angle documentary section at the Pusan Film Festival where it also received the Asian Network of Documentary (AND) Fund,  and Winner of Muhr Asia Africa / Documentary /Special Mention : Ashvin Kumar (Director) at the Dubai International Film Festival"
1689,"Inshallah, Kashmir","The film opens with ex-militants describing the torture they underwent when captured by the army. A Hindu describes his sentiment on being a part of the minority in the region at the height of militancy, when his grandfather was shot dead by militants. A politician and her husband describe the horror of being kidnapped and in captivity for over a month – and despite that, forming a human bond with the militants, and helping them escape when the army closed in on them. One understands from this section that militancy was not binary in nature. It was a dynamic and complex, resulting from various socio-political, economic and religious issues.
Disappearances and fake encounters led to the creation of mass graves, hidden away in sensitive border areas that civilians and journalists are not permitted to access in the name of national security. Human rights lawyer and activist Parvez Imroz reveals to us the presence of almost a thousand such graves in the valley. Rape victims from Kunan Poshpora describe the trauma they went through at the hands of the army and the stigma that they still face due to the incident.
The film also narrates how the minority Hindu Kashmiri Pandits were effectively cleansed from the valley as the majority of them fled the Islamic Terrorists. At several points in the movie, Kashmiri Muslims describe how the males are picked up and taken to Pakistan to be trained as terrorists. One former terrorist describes how his job will not be completed until Islam is spread through India and the World. He is prepared to die as he is firmly convinced he will go to heaven – though he cannot describe his concept of heaven. One Kashmiri woman openly admits that she sympathises with Pakistani Militants as they are Muslim. There are no interviews with the Indian Military in the movie.
The film then leads us to 'normalcy' or the social ramifications the last twenty years of devastation brought to the valley. Militancy in Kashmir resulted in the Government of India deploying tens of thousands of armed troops in the region. We hear the story of one boy who lost his leg because he was caught in crossfire. The film ends on a poignant note with a young artist saying 'I need my space.'"

They lead a normal life until Gautam's sixth birthday, when they lose Gautham at a crowded beach. The police are not very helpful as Gautham is not the child of anyone with influence. However, after much pestering, the local inspector has one of his men take Ram and Lizzy to the slums in north Chennai to meet a petty criminal, Nayanar, who knows about all the crimes done by the dwellers in his area. Initially, he pretends not to know anything. However, after Lizzy begs at his feet, he finally reveals that Gautham might have been taken to Nagari in neighboring Andhra Pradesh to be sold to a local pimp, Krishna Rao. Ram then leaves for the pimp's brothel with two friends but finds that Rao only deals with grown women and not little children.
Back in Chennai, Ram goes to meet Nayanar, who accidentally let slip that Gautham might have been taken to another town in Andhra Pradesh although he is unsure of it. Coincidentally, the taxi driver, Rangan, who drove Ram and Lizzy to the slums, earlier meets Ram and tells him he has driven a businessman from that town back to his home after meeting Nayanaar a few years ago. The driver reluctantly agrees to take Ram there. Back in Andhra Pradesh, Ram and Rangan meet the businessman, Nallama Reddy who claims to lead an honest living by selling rice. However, Ram realizes Reddy is lying as the temple board states he is a quarry dealer. Ram holds Reddy's grandson at gunpoint and forces Reddy to reveal where Gautham is. Reddy then tells Ram his son might have been taken to a butchery at a nearby town.
At the butchery, the local gangsters already know that Ram is coming for them. Ram is prepared to face their attack. While struggling with the gang, its leader tells Ram that he already killed Gautham and sold the other children he abducted to a child trafficker in Bhopal named Nikhil Motwani after Reddy told them Ram is coming. Once the gangsters are defeated, Ram searches for Gautham's body but instead finds the corpse of another boy. Realizing that the gangsters killed the wrong boy, Ram is confident that Gautham is being taken to Bhopal and leaves immediately.
At Bhopal, Ram and Rangan manage to arrange a meeting with Motwani by posing as businessmen, but the human trafficker recognizes Ram from the news. He tells Ram that Gautham is being held by his henchman, Diwakar, and they can only release the boy if they are paid 1 crore. With no other choice, Ram calls up Lizzy to prepare the money and is taken to Diwakar's hideout. Unable to control himself after seeing a young schoolgirl almost being raped, Ram saves her by fighting off Diwakar's men and taking her to the Times of India's headquarters. When Ram and Rangan return to the hideout, they find it empty. As they explore the place, they discover that Gautham and many other abducted children have been kept prisoned there all along. Ram becomes hysterical when he finds Gautham's shirt on the floor along with his scribblings on the wall.
Once they are back on the road, Ram phones Diwakar and begs him to return Gautham but is instead taunted at. Meanwhile, Lizzy calls Rangan to tell him that she had borrowed money from friends and has banked it into Diwakar's account. When she finds out it is no longer of any use, she is devastated and faints. As Ram and Rangan prepare to leave, they are shot at by an assassin hired by Motwani. Ram survives, but Rangan is fatally shot. Before dying, Rangan reveals to Ram that he was the driver hired to drive Gautham's abductors around Chennai in search of victims. He then pleads to Ram to not give up and continue searching for his son.
Now left alone, Ram remembers his final conversation with Diwakar, who told him Gautham might be sold in Lucknow or Calcutta. He goes to Calcutta first and searches for Gautham at every place where child laborers and minor sex workers are being kept. As he comes to accept the fact that Gautham is not in the city, he phones Lizzy, whom he has not spoken to in months. She asks him to come home as there is nothing they can do to find their son now.

1720,Aadukalam,"In Madurai, veteran rooster trainer Periyasamy aka ""Pettaikaaran"" and Madurai Central Police Inspector Rathnaswamy are tough competitors in cockfights, and it is often Pettai who wins because nobody knows his way of maintaining the quality of the birds. Rathnasamy and Pettai were once protegees of grand veteran Doraisamy, who has retired from active competition but is the overlord of rooster fighting in South Tamil Nadu.
K. P. Karuppu and Durai are the favourites in Pettai's team. Karuppu is very talented in breeding and training roosters, while Durai is very rich, owns three bars in the town of Thiruparankundram, and is talented in cock training. Rathnaswamy keeps insisting on having one last fight to win and satisfy his old mother's wish, but Pettai declines to have any more fights with him because he feels that Rathnaswamy has lost faith in his roosters and will be using nefarious methods to win. Rathnaswamy keeps insisting and tries to make him accept the challenge through cajoling, threatening, bribing, and other vile acts.
Karuppu falls in love with an Anglo-Indian girl named Irene, who dislikes him. He does not recognize this initially and keeps following her. One day, the residents of Irene's colony confront him and ask Irene to tell who she is in love with – Karuppu or Dinesh, another man in the locality. She points her finger at Karuppu, and he goes into rapture. She explains later that she had to lie in order to avoid Dinesh, who has been bothering her for a long time. Later, Irene too falls in love with Karuppu.
Meanwhile, Rathnasamy tries to cajole Ayub, Pettai's veterinarian for roosters, to get Pettai to come for a competition against himself, in exchange for a heavy amount. Ayub refuses and insults Rathnasamy. The same night, Ayub is killed in a hit and run accident. Durai initially suspects Rathnaswamy, and all of Pettai's gang wants revenge, but Pettai decides to conduct a state tournament in Ayub's name and provide his family with funds so that Ayub's poor daughters can be married. He asks permission from Rathnasamy as the police have to permit it, but Rathnaswamy refuses, manhandles, and berates Pettai as a thief. In a rage, Pettai, suspecting Rathnaswamy of the murder, agrees to the one-on-one rooster fight that Rathnaswamy has been asking for so long. He bets that he will field his roosters against every rooster that Rathnaswamy brings to the field in the following tournament, and even if one of Pettai's roosters loses against Rathnaswamy's, Pettai will tonsure his head and face, publicly apologize to him, and will quit rooster fights. If Rathnaswamy is not able to beat at least one of his roosters, the same conditions will be applied on him, at the end of the day. Finally getting his way, Rathnaswamy permits the tournament.
The grand state tournament is arranged by Pettai's team, getting heavy funds and official permission. In the initial 11 fights, Rathnasamy's roosters are defeated by Pettai's. Rathnasamy brings high-bred roosters from Bangalore and enters them into the tournament. Seeing the quality of new roosters, Karuppu asks Pettai to let his rooster fight, but Pettai puts his rooster down and says that he will choose the best competing rooster himself. Karuppu surreptitiously enters the contest as Pettai's team before Pettai can choose the rooster because he needs to repay Irene for the loan he took to prepare his rooster for the fight. Pettai does not believe in Karuppu and his rooster announces that Karuppu will not represent Pettai, and the result of Karuppu's match will not be acknowledged by his team. However, the 'underdog' emerges victorious in three consecutive rounds, despite facing roosters spiked with steroids. Karuppu gets the best coach award of the tournament and his bet money of ₹10 lakh (equivalent to ₹18 lakh or US$22,000 in 2020).
While initially happy that Karuppu won, Pettai is soon overcome with anger and jealousy. His ego is hurt by the fact that Karuppu earns both popularity and money, by refuting his judgement. Karuppu is not aware of the changes in Pettai's mind. Pettai is at first refusing to speak to anyone and then starts scheming. Karuppu gives Pettai the money from the competition for safekeeping, which he plans to use to start a business, but it goes missing. Pettai also starts spinning stories about his associates and makes everyone suspicious of each other. He incites Karuppu and Durai into pitting their roosters in a fight. Meanwhile, Karuppu's mother dies from the shock of losing all the money. Pettai poisons Durai's roosters, making him suspect Karuppu, who is arrested for this. Pettai then lies to Irene that his wife was in an adulterous relationship with Karuppu. Irene's family also pressures her to move to Chennai, which pushes her into attempting suicide. Pettai, meanwhile, calls Karuppu to a location near a temple and informs Durai about his whereabouts. When Irene recovers, she calls Karuppu and informs him that Pettai is badmouthing him, so Karuppu goes to find Pettai and confront him. Karuppu finds that Pettai was the one who stole his money, and a guilt-ridden Pettai kills himself. Karuppu does not wish to reveal the fact to the public that Pettai stole his money and schemed against him, so he flees with Irene to start a new life in another city, leaving the money with his friend."

Violators are severely punished and at times killed by Dora's henchman Sambadu. The tribe, however, believes that Dora is a do-gooder who is equal to God. Rangadu's son Giddadu is responsible for herding the sheep. One day, he comes across a radio with a cotton candy distributor and exchanges it for a lamb. Sambadu is furious that the lamb was traded without his knowledge and brutally thrashes Giddadu. The tribe's priest is unable to heal Giddadu and asks everyone to pray the God for his life. They listen to the murmuring sound of the radio and follow its instructions to save Giddadu. The tribe, who have no knowledge of what a radio is, believe it's an incarnation of God speaking to them.
Meanwhile, Dora's only child is in critical condition due to jaundice. The tribe meets Dora and asks his permission to build a temple for their newfound God. Upon hearing that God saved Giddadu, Dora accepts their proposal with an intention to sacrifice Giddadu to save his child's life. He sets up a painted electrical pole as Dhwaja Stambham and inaugurates the temple. Dora and his assistant Lingayya realize that the tribe was praying to the radio but laugh it off. During their celebration, Giddadu is kidnapped and sent for sacrifice. The tribe watches a light climb up the hill and believes God was taking Giddadu away. Ranga helplessly begs God to save Giddadu, and the radio replies to stop the light before it reaches the hilltop. Ranga runs to save Giddadu but the light reaches the hilltop before him. While returning, he comes across Chandram and Srinu who met with an accident. Rangadu takes them to their village for treatment. The tribe is wary of outsiders but the radio asks them to treat their relatives nicely. Upon realizing that Dora was using the villagers as his salves for his illegal Cannabis cultivation, Chandram exposes him when Dora kicks the priest for non-compliance. The tribe still refuses to believe that Dora is evil, and sends Chadram and Srinu away upon his orders. Later, they are kidnapped by Dora who orders his men to kill them. While they are being taken to the hilltop on a tractor, Chandram wakes up and fights off the driver. The tribe for the first time watches the light (which is revealed to be the tractor's headlight) come down the hill and believe that Chandram is sent back by God. 
Chandram makes the tribe listen to Hiranyakashipu and Prahlada's story on the radio, and compares Dora to the evil Hiranyakashipu and the tribe to the benevolent Prahlada. He convinces them that he had met the God who asked him to rid the village of Dora. On the other hand, Dora's child is dead and Sambadu complains to him that they lost their hold on the tribe due to the radio. Dora and his men attack the tribe who fights back. Sambadu goes on to destroy the radio but Rangadu kills him in retaliation. Dora hacks Rangadu from behind and dares God to kill him if he exists. Lightning strikes the electric pole and kills Dora who was standing beneath it."
1724,Aakrosh (1980 film),"Allegedly based on a true incident reported on page 7 of a local newspaper, the film was a scathing satire on the corruption in the judicial system and the victimization of the underprivileged by the able and the powerful.Aakrosh forms a part of the series of works, based around explorations in violence, written by noted playwright Vijay Tendulkar, who had earlier written Shyam Benegal's Nishant (1974) and went on to write Govind Nihalani's next surprise breakaway hit, Ardh Satya (1983).
Here the victim is shown so traumatized by excessive oppression and violation of his humanity, that he does not utter a single word almost for the length of the film and only bears a stunned look, though later he uses the same violence as a tool to express his own sense of violation and rage.Basically, the story is of a peasant who is oppressed by landowners and his foremen while trying to eke out a living as a daily laborer. His comely wife, played by Smita Patil, is raped by the foreman who then has him arrested to hide his own crime. His wife commits suicide out of shame.
Soon after his father's death, the police bring him to the funeral grounds in manacles and shackles to complete the last rites of his dead father. Standing beside the burning funeral pyre, he sees the foreman looking at his pre-pubescent sister with lustful eyes. Divining the fate that is in store for her, he grabs an axe and chops off his sister's head to forestall her dire future as a perpetual victim, as he sees it. Upon completion of this hapless act of a desperate and downtrodden man, he raises his face towards the skies and screams, and screams and screams – the second time that we hear his voice in the movie (the first is in a flashback, as he vainly attempts to rescue his wife) — a device similar to Andrei Tarkovsky's showing of the icons in brilliant color at the end of his three-hour black-and-white film Andrei Rublev."
1725,Aalayam (film),"Ramalingam is an honest, principled man, working as a clerk in a company. He values integrity and discipline as the doctrines of daily life.

The inner conflicts that torture Ramalingam in that single day and the final decision that he takes form rest of the film."
1726,Aalayamani,"Thyagarajan (Sivaji Ganesan) is a lonely rich bachelor, subjected to a deep-seated trauma from having witnessed the death of a childhood playmate, caused by his possessiveness. This is recurring theme in Thyagarajan's life, leading to disastrous results.
The movie begins with an imposing bell being rung, a voice narrates the story of a poor man, Arumugam Pillai, who was about to commit suicide on the death rock, but was stopped by the sound of the divine bell from the temple. He decides to take another chance with his life and soon he becomes a rich man and his son is none other than Thyagu, our hero!
Thyagarajan meets and becomes close friends with a virtuous man Sekhar (S. S. Rajendran) and there is a well grown sense of mutual admiration and fondness amongst the friends. Sekhar and Meena (B. Saroja Devi) are in love and Sekar promises he will ask her hand in marriage. Unbeknownst to both of them, Thyagu comes across Meena, whose father (Nagayya) works in Thyagu's estate and impressed by her vivacity, Thyagu falls head over heels for her. This has all the makings of a typical love triangle.
Meena has a sister, Pushpalatha, who falls in love with the villain's (M. R. Radha) son who demands a large amount in dowry. Nagayya is unable to rustle up the requisite cash and is now in the doldrums concerned about the fate of his elder daughter's marriage. Thyagu comes helping with the cash and they are wedded. Shortly thereafter, Thyagu proposes to marry Meena and sends Sekhar as his messenger.
Except Sekhar and Meena, to their obvious shock and despair, it looks to the rest of the relatives that Thyagu and Meena are a pair made for each other. Sekhar, realising the extent of love and the depth of feelings of Thyagu asks Meena to forgo their feelings and that she should go ahead and marry Thyagu. The family members of both the families get together and agree to the arrangement. By this time, Thyagu, injured in a serious accident loses the use of both his legs and ends up being a cripple for life. The loyal partner Meena pitches into the effort to care for Thyagu and spends all her time caring for him.
Sekhar can't forget Meena and tries to be close with her, while she honours her commitment to Thyagu and keeps Sekhar at a distance. Thinking Sekhar as a single, Prema (C. R. Vijayakumari), daughter of the villain, expresses her feelings for Sekhar and he fails to respond in kind.
All these pent up emotions of love, friendship, loyalty, jealousy and physical debilitation boils over at one point and things take a turn for the worse for all three. Goaded by the feelings of inadequacy, Thyagu builds in his mind a picture, that his dear friend Sekhar is out to get his love, and decides to take matters into his hands and get rid of Sekhar. The lingering doubts about his friend and lover is now fuelled by his restive passions which are burning brightly.
Thyagu plans that the appropriate location for revenge is the Death rock known for its enchanting scenery and dangerous cliffs, where once his father attempted suicide. He was to drive Sekhar to the edge and push him to death from the face of the cliff. Thyagu leads Sekhar to the cliff and reveals his anger and frustration about their perceived relationship, questioning the sincerity of his friend and his lover. A visibly angered Sekhar repulses by revealing the magnitude of his sacrifice he made for his close friend and to prove his innocence, Sekhar swears to take his own life from the same Death rock. Truth dawns on Thyagu, now deeply humiliated, jumps from the cliff to the tumultuous sea below.
While Sekhar and Meena are mourning for their loss, Thyagu gets rescued by a fisherman and the shock of falling from the cliff has given back Thyagu the partial use of his legs. Meena now deems her as a widow and convinces Sekhar to marry the girl who loves him. On the wedding day, Thyagu, now dressed as a nobody shows up for the wedding and happens to overhear a conversation of Meena declaring that there is no life and happiness left due to Thyagu's death. This convinces Thyagu to reveal his identity and console Saroja, while the villain with an eye on Thyagu's money thinks otherwise. Thyagu is hit on the head and falls unconscious, the marriage completes and Meena decides to take her life from the same cliff Thyagu plunged to death and seen running towards the cliff. Conscious now, Thyagu goes after Meena to stop her from committing suicide, calling out loud to stop and limping all the way behind her.
Meena sees Thyagu is alive and changes her mind and the lovers unite. In the background, the song ""Ponnai Virumbum Boomiyile"" (meaning: In a world of wealth lovers, the dear one who loved me) is being played, a happy Thyagu and Meena waves us a farewell, the movie ends."
1727,Aamhi Doghi,"Savitri (Priya Bapat) lives in Kolhapur with her father Jagdish Sardesai (Kiran Karmarkar), a well-known lawyer. Jagdish is an emotionally unavailable, distant and cold man, who believes in practical and rational behavior. He is also an authoritarian father. In the absence of a mother and a busy father, Savitri (Savi) is brought up largely by servants and staff of the large house in which they live. Despite refusing to remarry after the death of his wife (Savi's mother), Jagdish brings home a new bride Amla (Mukta Barve) from one of his work trips, when Savi is 15 years old, without consulting or informing her. Although she is upset about this, she eventually develops curiosity and also begins a genial friendship with Amla, who she calls 'Ammi'.
While Savi and Ammi are very different (Ammi is illiterate whereas Saavi is a school-topper, Saavi is hot-headed and stubborn while Ammi is quiet and patient) they both bond and look forward to each other's company. Ammi also tries to bring emotional depth to the cold and distant relationship between father and daughter. However, things between the two come to a head and Savi leaves home to pursue higher studies in Mumbai.
While in Mumbai, Savi completes her Masters, topping the university and gets a fellowship at a research institute of her choice. She also befriends Ram (Bhushan Pradhan) who is enamoured by her outspoken honesty, practicality and straightforwardness. Soon, Savi moves into a rented apartment and begins a relationship with Ram. Despite her father's calls, she does not go back to Kolhapur. One day, as she is leaving to attend an office party thrown for her by her boss, Ammi shows up at her door. She informs Savi that her father passed away 15 days ago, but did not want to inform her. She shows Savi his will, wherein he leaves his entire property to Saavi, on the condition that she allow Ammi to live with her as her mother. Savi is initially angry at her father's actions, but lets Ammi stay with her. Saavi and Ammi once again come close and bond with each other, with Savi even introducing Ammi as her 'mother' instead of 'step-mother', like she would earlier.
In the meanwhile, Ram and Savi start having relationship trouble as Ram is pressured into marrying by his family. He wants to marry Savi, but Savi doesn't believe in the institution of marriage. After an argument, Ram leaves for Nagpur, his family home, for an office project. He tells Savi he doesn't know when he will return. A few weeks later, Savi finds out from mutual friends that Ram has married an old family friend. Savi is upset but doesn't show it, focusing instead on why Ram would choose to marry such an ordinary girl. At this time, Ammi consoles her, telling her she should be happy that Savi and Ram only knew love in their relationship, and not the 'practicalities' of marriage that Savi detested.
As Savi gets back to normal, she comes home to find Ammi shivering in bed. Ammi faints and Savi takes her to the hospital, where she finds that Ammi is in the last stage of leukemia. She is further shocked when the doctor tells her Ammi has known about this all along. Ammi then tells her that their fathers were classmates. Savi's father knew of Ammi's sickness when they married. Ammi came from a very poor family and had nothing. Once when Savi's father came to visit them in Belgaum, Ammi had just lost her father, and had no one else, nor any money. Taking pity on her, and with the assumption that she would make a good companion to Savi, her father married Ammi, however they never had any sexual relations. She tells Savi her father cared for her very well, arranging for medicines, doctors and more whenever necessary.
As she breathes her last, she tells Savi not to bottle up her feelings, to set them free, just as she believes in freedom in relationships. When Ammi dies, Savi finally cries for the first time in her life. Savi sells her childhood home in Kolhapur, choosing to only keep the things that remind her of Ammi and open herself up to others, just as she did with Ammi."

1814,Ankur (film),"Ankur is a complex film that analyzes human behaviour in general and heavily stresses characterisation (though the story is not fictional). The story revolves around two characters, Lakshmi and Surya.
Lakshmi (Shabana Azmi) lives in a village with her husband Kishtayya (Sadhu Meher), a deaf-mute alcoholic potter who communicates using gestures. The couple is poor and belongs to the lowly Dalit caste. Lakshmi attends a village festival and prays faithfully to the Goddess, stating that her only desire in life is to have a child.
Surya (Anant Nag), the son of the village landlord, had just finished his studies in the nearby city of Hyderabad and arrives back home. Surya's father (Khader Ali Beg) has a mistress named Kaushalya with whom he has an illegitimate son named Pratap. Surya's father claims to have given Kaushalya ""the best land in the village"", a gift which serves as both a token of his affection and also keeps Kaushalya quiet and satisfied. Surya is forced by his father into a child marriage with the under aged Saru (Priya Tendulkar), and begins to feel extremely sexually frustrated due to the fact that they cannot have sex until Saru reaches puberty.
Surya reluctantly takes over the administrative responsibilities of his share of land in the village. Alone, he moves into a different, older house, and Lakshmi and Kishtayya are sent as his servants. Not long after his arrival, he begins to exert his authority by introducing a number of different laws and measures, many of which are controversial among the village people. Almost immediately, Surya starts to form an attraction towards Lakshmi, and gives her the task of cooking his meals and serving him tea. This does not sit well with the village priest, a man who traditionally delivers food to the landowner, though at a higher price than Lakshmi asks.
Surya also hires Kishtayya to ride his bullock cart and run his errands. The following day, he has Kishtayya collect fertilizer from the landlord's house. Surya then uses Kishtayya's absence to flirt with Lakshmi, but she fails to reciprocate. In the meantime, the villagers have begun to gossip, and many (most notably the overseer, Police Officer Patel Sheikh Chand) believe that Surya has already slept with Lakshmi, and will act in the same way that his father did - try to conceal the scandal by giving his mistress a vast plot of land.
Kishtayya is caught stealing toddy, after which he is publicly humiliated, and he decides to leave the village due to the embarrassment. In his absence, Surya and Lakshmi sleep together. Some time later, Saru arrives at the village, in order to live with her husband. Saru does not approve of Lakshmi's presence, partly because Lakshmi is a Dalit and partly because Saru has heard the villagers' rumours. The next morning, Lakshmi has morning sickness, and Saru fires her, claiming that she is too sick to work.
Many days go by, and eventually Kishtayya returns, having cured himself of his alcoholism and made some money. Lakshmi is overwhelmed with a feeling of guilt, because she believes that she has betrayed her husband. On discovering Lakshmi's pregnancy, he salutes the village goddess at her temple, acknowledging that his wife's wish has been granted. He then decides to return to work and hopefully ride the bullock cart once again for Surya. Surya sees Kishtayya and mistakenly believes that Kishtayya is seeking revenge from him due to his infidelity with Lakshmi.
Surya orders three men to grab hold of Kishtayya and then proceeds to whip him with a rope used for lynching. The commotion attracts others, including Sheikh Chand and Pratap, to the scene, and Lakshmi rushes to defend her husband. She angrily curses Surya, then slowly returns home with Kishtayya. In the final scene, after the others have left, a young child throws a stone at Surya's glass window and runs away."

But after a heated argument, Dhayalan's wife attempts suicide for this and he agrees against his conscience and enrolls their son in the playschool.
As the boys grow, their fathers imbue different social aspects into their children.

He teaches his son to follow a path of truth and integrity, considering human values above everything else. He also teaches his son how to behave friendly and talk socially with others.

1841,Arangetram (film),"Ramu Shastrigal is a poor Brahmin living with his wife Visalam and their eight children. His rigid principles and obstinate behaviour become obstacles to his family's progress. His spendthrift sister Janaki lands in his house with her daughter, adding to their woes and penury. Lalitha, the eldest daughter of Ramu Shastrigal, is enthusiastic to work but her father does not permit it. She bonds with the family's neighbour Nadesa Udaiyaar and his son Thangavelu. Thangavelu sympathises with Lalitha's condition and fondly presents a saree to her, which she accepts. However, Ramu Shastrigal insists that it should be thrown out and complains about this to Udaiyaar, who then berates Thangavelu for his act. Thangavelu expresses his love for Lalitha and his desire to marry her; when Udaiyaar refuses to permit it, he leaves the house. Thangavelu's sudden exit depresses Lalitha.
Ramu Shastrigal's family suffers due to poverty; on many nights, they go to bed hungry. When Lalitha's hungry brother shares a meal with a beggar, she decides to disobey her father and with Udaiyaar's help, obtains employment. Her income supplements the family and their standard of living improves. Her brother Thyagu aspires to become a doctor; Lalitha runs from pillar to post to get him a seat in a medical college. When she meets a man for facilitating his admission in a medical college in Madras, he exploits her desperation and rapes her. Lalitha keeps quiet about this incident and goes back to work. She shifts to Hyderabad, where she gets promoted with a higher salary. Immediately after taking up the new assignment, she asks her employer for a salary advance to be sent to Thyagu for his admission fee; realising her vulnerability, he demands her carnal company. She yields and he gives her the money. Demands from her family increase and to earn more money, she takes to prostitution. While her family lives prosperously, Lalitha suffers silently.
One day, Thangavelu lands in Lalitha's house looking for a prostitute. Both are shocked to see each other; Thangavelu, who was believed to have died after leaving home, is upset that Lalitha has fallen so low and leaves. As years pass, Lalitha's siblings progress; Thyagu becomes a doctor, sister Mangalam becomes a singer; younger sister Devi falls in love with Pasupathy, son of a landlord, and their marriage is fixed. Lalitha returns home after a long time and is warmly received. But she feels depressed and frustrated to know that her mother is again in the family way and criticises her parents' lack of responsibility. On the day of Devi's wedding, Lalitha is shocked to see that Pasupathy, her client in Hyderabad, is the groom. She fears he would cancel the wedding knowing that the bride is her sister, but he performs the wedding rituals mechanically and looks withdrawn. Lalitha and Pasupathy meet privately, decide to forget past incidents and move on. When Udaiyaar is about to perform the thevasam for his son, Lalitha intervenes and reveals that Thangavelu is alive, but does not explain the circumstances under which they met.
Thyagu falls in love with Bhama, a Tehsildar’s daughter, and their engagement is arranged. When Ramu Shastrigal and Visalam go to Udaiyaar's house to invite him for the engagement, they meet Thangavelu, who has returned home and ask him where he met Lalitha. He remains silent, but after they leave, tells his father how and where he met Lalitha. Lalitha's parents overhear this and are shocked; Ramu Shastrigal and Thyagu disown Lalitha. The Tehsildar agrees to continue the wedding only if Lalitha is sent out of home, and she is mercilessly thrown out by Thyagu and Ramu Shastrigal. Udaiyaar, who understands her sacrifices, takes her to his home. To give her the dignity he deserves, he requests Thangavelu to marry her, which he accepts. The wedding of Thangavelu and Lalitha takes alongside Thyagu's wedding with Bhama. Though Lalitha is grateful to Udaiyaar and Thangavelu for their magnanimity, the trauma she has undergone results in her becoming insane."
1842,Aranyer Din Ratri,"The plot of the movie goes back to a similar outing the writer Sunil Gangopadhyay took in the early days of his poetic career. The story unfolds around a group of four friends, who despite their differences, bonded deeply. The four friends are all educated and come from different layers of society, but the urge to escape from the daily grind of city life forces them to wander in tribal lands.
Of the four friends, Asim, the leader of the pack, owns the car they drive in, has a cushy job, likes the company of girls and yet is very conscious of how he should be perceived by them. Sanjoy is a labour executive but would ideally want to immerse himself in literature.  Hari, a frank and straightforward cricketer, wants to forget the girl who dumped him. Shekhar is the jester, the only one without a job. He has a roving eye but stays sober when his friends get drunk and vent their frustrations.
They set out for the tribal Palamau, in Bihar. They had read legends about this land, the tribal women who are open, simple and beautiful.  Wanting to break rules, they forcefully stay at a forest rest house by bribing the chowkidar. The stay symbolizes their distance from city life and civilization: they wonder whether to shave or not. Hari gets close to tribal Santhal girl Duli when she approaches the group for extra drink.
Their resolve to be unshaven collapses when Shekhar sees two ladies Aparna and her sister-in-law Jaya in the forest. They introduce themselves to their family. The two urban groups of people are almost relieved to find each other here. Asim flirts with Aparna and coaxes her to show her room. He is attracted to the elegant and enigmatic Aparna, but is unable to keep pace with her composure, presence of mind and intelligence. At night the four friends go to drink alcohol again in the country liquor house. Hari is upset because he cannot see Duli whom he had met previous night. While returning to their rest house, they stumble upon a car which they shout at without realising it is that of Aparna and Jaya. They oversleep and miss the next day's breakfast at Jaya's place. They find a tiffin outside their rooms and go to Aparna's house to return it. Later, the conservator visits the forest rest house and catches them staying at the Forest Bungalow without permission. When they are about to be kicked out, Aparna, the conservator's acquaintance, manages the situation with her natural grace and composure. The group decides to chat and play a game while Aparna's father is away with Jaya's son. The game reaches a crescendo, with only Asim and Aparna left in the fray, at which point Aparna pulls out, deliberately handing victory to Asim, who seems to have placed his entire confidence at stake on the win.
The tensions peak at the village fair where the four friends go their own way. Shekhar goes off to gamble with money borrowed from Asim. Hari takes Duli into the forest and has sex with her. Asim feels his pride and self-confidence shattered when Aparna reveals her more vulnerable side that lies behind her composed exterior. She also holds up a mirror to his bourgeois and urban insensitivity by pointing out how despite having spent three days at the bungalow, he and his friends never bothered to inquire about the chowkidar's wife. Meanwhile, Shekhar finds himself helping all his friends (especially Hari, when the latter gets injured and robbed), despite being fondly considered to be the buffoon of the gang. Sanjoy, held back by his bourgeois moralities, is unable to respond to Jaya's bold advances.
The next morning, the four friends, leave for Calcutta since their new friends have had to return in a hurry. As a parting gift, they find a can of boiled eggs sent by the thoughtful Jaya."

But Rajeswari vetoes the alliance and instead suggests that Raghu marry Padma instead.

He comes from a family that is well respected in the village. But things have changed now; labourers are no more the bonded slaves who used to bend over for their landlords. Krishnan Unni still lives in the past glory days and refuses to change with time. The story takes a ""Kafkaish"" turn when a wart in his face takes a life of its own. What happens to Krishnan Unni forms the rest of the story.
The wart is a metaphor for the burden of old customs and traditions. Krishnan Unni, who is well rooted in the old traditional ways, refuses to change with the times. He refuses to get surgery on the wart, but tries to cure it with old way of herbal medicine. The lesson here is if one doesn't change with time, the old customs and blind faith will become a burden and, if one persists in them, there will be a time when they will take over, meaning all of a person's decisions will be based on how they traditionally did it or what the old scriptures or astrological charts dictate. After a while these old traditions and customs, will be taken out as something personal to an individual or a group and would be associated with god, it would be made into something holy. Now everybody has to do it as it is divine. Murali in the end shows how the wart which was growing in him escapes from Krishnan Unni and becomes a huge elephant. There are a bunch of priests who are looking at the elephant and they comment, such a big animal, we should keep it in the temple. The wart which was personal to one person has become divine and holy to everyone now. All he had to do to cure the wart was to seek the help of science."
1845,Arising from the Surface,"The screenplay of this film is based on two poems, two essays and six short stories by Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh and the title of film is taken from one of his short story used in the film. The film is neither a biopic nor an adaptation, or an essay, nor fiction, and yet it engages with all these forms producing a cinematic text that defies any categorization. The narrative is fashioned around three characters: Ramesh (Bharath Gopi) who embodies Muktibodh's subjectivity where as Madhav (Jha) and Keshav (M. K. Raina) are his companions. All three saunter in and out of numerous mise-en-scène, driven by the political, philosophical underpinnings of Muktibodh's universe."

1855,Astitva,"Astitva encompasses issues such as male chauvinism, extramarital affairs, and spousal abuse. It is about a woman trying to find an identity outside her marriage.
It is 1997. Malhar Kamat (Mohnish Bahl), an old musician and music teacher, is dying. He prepares his will where he leaves his entire jaydad (estate) — comprising a haveli (mansion), 1.5 acres (6,100 m2) of land, 1,400 grams of gold and approximately 860,000 rupees — to Aditi Shrikant Pandit (Tabu). Upon his death two years later, the will is delivered to Aditi.
When the will reaches Aditi in Pune, she is in the midst of an impromptu party occasioned by the arrival of Dr. Ravi Bapat (Ravindra Mankani) and his wife Meghna (Smita Jaykar). Ravi is a very close friend of Aditi's husband, Shrikant Pandit (Sachin Khedekar). Aditi and Shrikant's only child, Aniket (Sunil Barve) introduces his girlfriend and would-be wife Revati (Namrata Shirodkar) to everyone at the party.
Shrikant opens the certified package that contains the will, even though it is addressed to Aditi, much to Meghna's chagrin and Ravi's surprise. Shrikant is intrigued and refers to his diaries from 25 years ago, in which he has chronicled events from his daily life. He realises that Aditi could not have possibly been pregnant from him at that time, because he was travelling on work. He shows her the diary, confronts her with the facts, and demands an explanation.
In a flashback, Shrikant is an up-and-coming star at a firm, seeking to break out onto his own. His work keeps him traveling almost constantly. This leaves his newlywed wife Aditi lonely and frustrated.
When she asks him to let her work someplace (clearly to relieve her boredom and find a good use for her time), he takes it as an insult and rebuffs her saying no woman in his family has ever worked outside the home and that he earns enough for them to live comfortably. He suggests (although not very enthusiastically) that she take up music. The music teacher is Malhar Kamat. Shrikant continues his unending travels all over the world, although he makes it clear to Malhar that music will not be anything more than a hobby for Aditi.
Aditi's sister Sudha (Resham Tipnis) and her husband come to live with Aditi. Their constant lovemaking further deepens Aditi's feelings of yearning and abandonment. And one spring afternoon, as Malhar breaks into his new ghazal in the rain, Aditi's resolve is broken under the influence of the season. Malhar returns a couple of days later, and Aditi asks him to leave stating she loves only Shrikant. Aditi has missed a period. Sudha learns this and advises her to do something.
When Shrikant returns, Aditi breaks down and tries to tell him the truth about her pregnancy. But Shrikant is doubly elated, having won the first major contract for his own firm and, hearing of his imminent fatherhood, and breaks out into celebrations without letting Aditi complete her story.
As the story comes back to present time, Shrikant punishes Aditi by making her tell the truth in front of Aniket, Ravi and Meghna. Meghna loathes Shrikant, since she suffered spousal abuse from her drunkard husband before divorcing him and marrying Ravi. Aniket is disgusted with his mother after knowing the truth of his existence.
Ravi confronts Shrikant, reminding him of his many extramarital affairs. Shrikant refuses to accept it stating he is a man and he did not bring any children, born of those affairs, home.
Shrikant decides that he will live with Aditi, but any spousal relationship between them will not exist. After Revati knows the truth, she breaks the engagement, not because of the truth, but because she realizes that Aniket is no different from the man whom he considered his father till now.
Meghna decides to take Aditi to Goa with her, but Aditi declines. Before leaving the house, she demands her husband and son's presences to hear her. She states how her weakness is called sin, whereas Shrikant's weaknesses are accepted easily. She questions who has the authority to accept his weakness. Aditi also reveals to Shrikant that she has harbored another secret from him that he is impotent and that is why she was not able to bear children with him. And how she could have been made responsible for that too if she didn't have a child. Revati enters the house and gives her new generation views to Aniket stating he is alive as his mother didn't decide otherwise. Aditi walks out of the house with Revati. The movie ends with Revati and Aditi walking out the house and on the road, whilst Shri and Aniket stand in the doorway, watching them go.
The denouement captures the essence of astitva."
1856,Asukh,"Rohini asks her ex-boyfriend if he remembers her. Although he says yes, she doesn't believe him and instead asks for the medicine box and takes three to five sleeping pills. Even after Aniruddha forbids her, she takes them all, saying that it should not affect him. The reason for this bitterness is revealed. Aniruddha had left her for another girl named Mrittika. Rohini was a famous film star and her love for her man was unblemished. She had brought Mrittika into the industry, and suffered Caesar's wounds when Aniruddha started an affair with her. When Mrittika and Aniruddha started coming close, Rohini had confronted Aniruddha several times to tell the truth but he always tried to hide the fact and that had hurt her more. While she was facing such turbulent times in her life and wanted to be all alone, she learns that her mother is hospitalized with a high fever.
Unaware of the deteriorating relationship among Aniruddha and Rohini, her father often asks help from him despite Rohini showing irritation. She does not express her emotions as she knows her father is also going through tough times, nor is she able to digest the fact that Aniruddha is called off and on. She tries to avoid him, as we see couple of times, she lies to avoid him and even does not pick up any call assuming it to be Aniruddha. On the other hand, on seeing a difference in Rohini's behavior her father is upset; he even finds her taking frequent sleeping pills and is worried about her. Ghosh neatly brings in the father-daughter relationship –he shows how the father worries about his daughter even after she has grown up. There is a scene in the movie which shows that, when there is a power cut, her father doesn't allow her daughter to move, going himself to fetch the torch to light up the place, similarly like a father showing light of right path to their children. He didn't think that he himself can be hurt, but only thought to protect his child from the darkness just like a shield. There are some more scenes where Ghosh brilliantly brought out the pure love of a father for his daughter. In contrast, he also shows that even though her father is unwilling to take her money, he still has to depend on her, and this constantly bothers him, which is seen when he expresses his views to his wife that they are depending on her money completely.
The film also shows how a husband loves his wife; he is not only worried about her but also sad at the same time that she is far from him and suffering from pain. Despite being old himself, he never missed to go to the hospital one single day, buying all the medicines and other necessary itinerary. Due to her daughter's fame, when he was allowed to stay longer during visiting hours, the happiness in his face explained his love for his wife. Even Rohini quotes several times that even after she got betrayal and disappointment from her relation, she keeps consoling herself when she sees her parents; their relationship makes her feel that love has not vanished from the society, it's still present. But destiny plays it role and we are unable to predict the future. The same Rohini who thought of her parents' relation as pure, started doubting her father after her mother is attacked by fever again after the discharge from the hospital. They thought of taking second opinion and the doctor suggested for HIV test as he think this may be due to lack of immunity. The hatred was installed in her mind after getting betrayed by Aniruddha and she was unable to think rationally. She started thinking for the worst, repeatedly asking her father if the needles used were sterilized and on getting the same answer from him every time (that he himself bought the disposable injections every time), her mind was shrouded in doubt that her father was the only source for her mother's illness. Ghosh, may be for the first time, brought in to the Bengali cinemas the awareness for AIDS and at the same time dealt with fear and anxiety in a sensitive manner. The rude behavior of the daughter brings a distance between them but still father's love for her daughter did not diminish.
The blood test result revealed that her mother does not have AIDS. At the end, Rohini realizes her mistake; she realizes that everything is in one's mind, and people themselves can control that. She expresses all her sorrow to her father, when he learns that Aniruddha has left her. Her father consoles her but asks is she the person who said in an interview that there is no more love and trust left in the society. She says nothing but begs pardon from her father."

1861,Aval Appadithan,"Manju was raised in a dysfunctional family that consisted of a timid father and a philandering mother; she hurtles from one disastrous affair to another, leading to her degenerating into a cynical woman. Into her life enter two radically different men. One of them is her boss, Thyagu, who owns the advertising agency she works for. He is a stereotype of the successful man: money-minded, opinionated, arrogant, and a male chauvinist. In sharp contrast is Arun, who has come to Madras from Coimbatore to make a documentary on women. Sensitive and sincere, he believes his job has a purpose and is both shocked and amused at the cynical attitudes of Manju and Thyagu.
Manju has been drafted by Thyagu to assist Arun in his documentary. As Arun and Manju start working together, Arun begins to understand Manju's complex personality. She tells Arun about her unfortunate past relationships: How she was molested by her uncle, the ending of her first relationship in college when her lover left her by marrying another woman for the sake of employment, and how her second love, Mano, a Christian priest's son, used her to satisfy his needs and lust, calling her ""sister"" in front of her parents. These incidents have led to her present attitude towards men. Arun later shares these conversations with Thyagu, who warns him to steer clear of such women.
Inevitably, Arun falls for Manju. However Manju incurs Thyagu's wrath when he overhears her reprimanding her office staff for commenting on her character. When Thyagu also comments about her, she resigns from her job. When he learns of this, Arun requests Thyagu to re-employ her. Thyagu simply laughs and says that she is already back, after which Manju seems to have a change of heart and starts courting Thyagu. Arun is devastated to see that she has turned out to be just the sort of woman that Thyagu earlier said she was — opportunistic, money-minded, and fickle. When he asks her about her contradicting stands in life, she responds by saying that is the way she is and will be.
The truth finally emerges that Manju was merely baiting Thyagu to teach him a lesson. When Thyagu starts believing that Manju has fallen for him, he attempts to take advantage of her at a party banquet, but she rebukes and slaps him, after which Thyagu runs away in fright. However, this revelation comes too late for her, as Arun, who is disillusioned with her behaviour, has already married a small town girl. When Manju tells her aunt about the attempt to humiliate Thyagu and its ramifications, her aunt tells Manju that she deserved it for leaving behind a golden opportunity to start a new life. In a final discussion in Thyagu's car, Manju asks Arun's wife, ""What do you think of women's liberation?"". Arun's wife replies that she does not know. Manju cynically replies that this is why she (the wife) is happy. After Manju leaves, the car carrying Thyagu and the married couple pulls away from her. A voice-over says that Manju died today, but will be reborn tomorrow, only for the cycle to repeat, and that is how she is."

Her father and a few local politicians accuse Ravi for the death and protest in the hospital. Ravi is forced to flee through the back door, followed by the girl's relatives. He has an accident on the way and goes missing without any trace. The girl's death gains media attention, and the police start a thorough search for Ravi. The hospital management clears its name by sacking Ravi, but the chairman's private secretary Diya (Rima Kallingal) expresses dissatisfaction over the hospital's decision and starts a search on her own. She is very much attached to Ravi, who had once convinced her the importance of following ethics in the medical profession. She meets Dr. Vivek (Narain), who is a very close friend and a former classmate of Ravi.
At the private medical college where Ravi completed his medical degree, he and Vivek were amongst the worst students. They were irresponsible in their studies and were not even able to distinguish between surgical instruments. Ravi had a campus romance, a junior Muslim student named Sainaba aka Sainu (Samvrutha). After completing the course, Ravi and Vivek were left with two options: either to pay the college ₹5 lakh or to do an internship in a village hospital. Vivek opts to pay. Ravi, who is not able to get the cash from his father Thomas Tharakan (Prem Prakash), chooses to work in the Redemption Hospital in Munnar, which is run by Dr. Samuel (Prathap Pothen) — an altruistic physician who, by his absolute devotion to his profession, lives a lonely life. On his way to Munnar, Ravi's car crashes with a police vehicle. and Ravi is in turn harassed by S. I. Purushothaman (Kalabhavan Mani). Ravi lodges a complaint and gets the officer suspended.
Ravi initially finds the job at the hospital uninteresting, mainly due to the uncompromising Samuel, who is very strict. He hates the lonely stay in a ""jail-like"" staff-quarters. The only consolations for Ravi are the letters by Sainu and occasional phone calls to Vivek. Ravi is soon accompanied by Dr. Supriya (Remya Nambeesan), another junior doctor, who helps him develop an interest in the job. However, he still finds it difficult to adjust to Samuel. Some months later, Samuel informs Ravi about a phone call that he received from Sainu's parents, who are planning to marry Sainu to someone else. Samuel was also asked to forbid Ravi from meeting or calling her. Ravi seeks help from Vivek, who secretly makes all arrangements for Ravi's and Sainu's marriage in Kochi, but Ravi is stopped by Purushothaman on his way to Kochi, in the name of a routine check. The officer who was actually waiting to avenge his suspension does not leave Ravi even after hearing about the marriage. Ravi arrives late only to see a house arrested Sainu, who has unwillingly agreed for another marriage.
This incident shakes Ravi completely. His lonely stay in Munnar also haunts him, but he is able to be sincere to his job. One day, a girl is brought to the hospital in a serious condition. Ravi, the only duty doctor, rushes to her but decides not to attend the case after knowing that she is Purushothaman's daughter. He rejects the requests of hospital staff and other inmates. Not even the tears shed by Purushothaman at his feet are enough to melt his heart. The girl's condition becomes very serious, but she is saved by Samuel, who arrives sometime later. An angry Samuel slaps Ravi for his negligence. Insulted, Ravi decides to leave the place immediately but is stopped by Supriya, who supports Samuel's action. The next day, Ravi is summoned by a committee for investigation of a complaint filed by Purushothaman. Ravi is silent throughout the interrogation, and the committee decides to recommend that the Medical Council cancel his recognition. However, Samuel testifies for Ravi stating that Ravi is innocent and since the girl is saved, there arises no case of medical negligence. This incident and Samuel's testifying turns out to be an eye-opener for Ravi. His attitude to the purpose of life changes completely which he is able to follow throughout his later life. He leaves Redemption Hospital after his internship and leaves for London to pursue his higher studies, and later works in hospitals and gains a name for being service-minded.
Having known more about Ravi from Vivek and Supriya, Diya comes to the conclusion that Ravi might have gone to meet Samuel. The police also tracks him at Munnar after tracing his phone calls. In a cemetery, Ravi is shown talking to Samuel about the girl's death, but it is later shown that Samuel is no more and that it was the news of Samuel's death that brought Ravi to Munnar. Ravi is arrested by the police and is brought to court. He is acquitted in the case after the dead girl's mother testifies for Ravi stating that it was upon her behest that Ravi opted to operate the girl.

1876,Baba Baby O,"40-something Megh decides to have babies through surrogacy. His life takes a u-turn when he meets Brishti. The film tries to highlight that love can happen anywhere, anytime.
The film begins with Megh becoming a father through surrogacy to two little boys (later referred to as Potol-Posto). Due to his constant denial and disinterest in marriage, his father comes to doubt if he is gay and in a relationship with his best friend. However he reveals that his disinterest is not only due to his age but also due to rejection he faced from his former girlfriend due to his love and desire for children.
Megh goes to a toy shop to buy toys for his boys, sees Brishti scolding a man for his indecent comments. Megh, as his caring nature suggests, rescues Brishti from the ruckus, also having developed a crush on her. Through numerous encounters henceforth, he helps Brishti in various ways. It is eventually revealed that Brishti has a sour relationship with her mother due to her second marriage as she believes her mother dumped her father, while it is the vice versa. It is also revealed that she hates kids as she believes they are irrational and impractical unlike adults which breaks Megh's heart. Enter Souvik, Brishti's boyfriend, who plans to shift to Sydney with Brishti and sell the house and toy shop that Brishti and her mother have inherited from the latter's second marriage. This makes Brishti's mother furious and Brishti leaves the house with Souvik. Brishti seeks help from Megh and he finds them an apartment beside his own flat for rent. A beautiful relationship develops between Megh's parents, Brishti and Megh's children, whom Brishti begins to accept.
We see the constant neglect that Souvik offers in the relationship to Brishti, not being there when she needs him the most, unlike Megh, who always open heartedly tries to hear Brishti out. Brishti finds a letter in her luggage which was written by her biological father to her mother before she got married for the second time, stating that he has happily settled again and Brishti must not know of how he has dumped her. Brishti regrets not accepting her adoptive father and her mother's marriage when her adoptive father was actually alive. She tries to contact Souvik who is out of the house, but not getting any support from him, calls Megh instead. Megh consoles her. Brishi reconciles with her mother.
Some days later, as Brishti is about to leave for sydney with souvik, her mother shows her a picture of Megh and approves him over Souvik, as he kept sending Brishti's pictures to her mother all the while that she was away.
Brishti and Souvik have lunch at Megh's place and Brishti leaves for sydney with a heavy heart. Megh realises how important Brishti is to him and goes to stop her when his parents motivate him, however in vain. He returns home only to find Brishti waiting for him. From here onwards the director's open end trick works. It is shown that Megh imagines himself having a conversation with Brishti after entering the room. She tells him that she was always confused if Megh was her father or her lover due to his fatherly nature, hinting of the void of the fatherly love that she had always craved for. Megh assures her that she is free to love him in whatever way. Brishti says she might not be a good mother to Potol Posto but can be a good friend to them. Megh tells her that every kind of love has an affection and she is free to mould their children in any way she wants. Megh and Brishti reconcile, a happy family scene is shown, hinting at their marriage and love filled life with a sense of freedom ahead. But the moment Megh is back and another Megh is portrayed imagining the entire thing with all the other cast ignoring Megh to be back signifies that Brishti didn't return. The imagination of what could have happened if Brishti returns is what shown in the end. Many will be mistaken on this perspective and would consider this as a happy ending which is rather unrequited. One can think of all realistic possibilities to support the fact that Brishti is back but that won't be a justified one both in reality and technically. This film's climax is much more than just a happy ending. This is why this film stands out in a different way altogether. When all the 90s romantic film incidents are proven wrong in one way or the other in reality, the ending also somehow breaks the stereotype of typical happy ending of romantic films."
1877,Babli Bouncer,"Babli Tanwar (Tamannaah Bhatia) is an uneducated young girl from Asola Fatepur, a small village near Delhi where most people are bouncers.

The most important symbol of the Hindavi Swarajya, the forts of Shivaji are long forgotten. The once majestic fort overlooking this buzzing town lays in ruins, tainted with tobacco laden spit, garbage, empty beer bottles and lovers declaring their love for each other on the same walls where the brave mawlas spilt their blood for Swarajya.What is this outrageous plan?

She visits a local jewellery shop to try on jewels (in pretence that she will buy) that she cannot afford. There a rich man, Nawab Sikandar Mirza, sees her and falls in love with her.  Zeenat, on the other hand, is in love with Nawab Yusuf, and they meet each other at a nearby Sufi shrine every Thursday.
In a twist of fate, Yusuf's uncle connivingly fixes her marriage with Nawab Sikandar Mirza, though she assumes it is with Yusuf. When she finds the truth, it is the day of marriage. Dressed as a bride she goes to the local shrine hoping to meet Yusuf there, as it's Thursday. But because Yousuf is out of town, he never shows up and Zeenat faints. On the other side the marriage ceremony has commenced without her, as everyone believes that Bride (as per the custom of that time) is in her carriage behind the curtains, and her silence is equivalent to saying ""I Do"".  At Nawab Sikander Mirza's Haveli, the 'doli' comes empty. Unknown to him as to what happened, he and his sister Suraiya hide the fact that Bahu Begum isn't in it, but instead proclaim that she is ill, and thus no one is able to meet her.
Zeenat wakes up at the shrine past midnight and returns home but her disgraced and enraged father asks her to leave. She then goes to Yusuf's house to seek shelter, not knowing that he is out of town, and is told by his maternal Uncle, Mir Qurbani Ali, that Yusuf does not love her and has relocated to Allahabad for a few months. She then goes to her in-laws but is unable to speak freely with her 'husband' as he is angry and distracted. Devastated she runs away from there to go back to the nearby dargah (Sufi shrine), but trips and falls in front of a horse carriage being ridden by a courtesan, returning from her late night function. Zeenat wakes up at the home of the courtesan, Nazeeran Bai, who had rescued her from the road.
Her misfortune has taken her to a Kotha (bawdy-house). Her father and supposed husband, meanwhile, are hiding the truth and pretending all is well in order to keep their honour. But thereafter destiny brings her to that place only which is supposed to be her in-laws' house, i.e., the residence of Sikandar Mirza. She is sent there to sit in as ""temporary wife"" to facilitate the marriage of her sister-in-law Suraiya. When Zeenat arrives, Sikandar Mirza who along with his sister Suraiya is pleasantly surprised to see that the real bride or the Bahu Begum has finally come to her destination. Her arrival is a great sigh of relief for them and now they pleasantly show the Bahu Begum to the outsiders (females only due to the tradition of Muslim ladies' remaining behind the veil in the presence of the males not belonging to them).
But Zeenat tells Sikandar Mirza that when the marriage ceremony (Nikah) was being performed by the Qaazi (Muslim priest), she was not present at the place behind the curtain and she had not given her consent for the marriage as per the custom of the Nikaah and therefore, she is not his wife as per the law and the religion. However she adds that she will never leave him, because his honour as well as the honour of his family is too important for her to take any such step, and she will remain the Bahu Begum of the household for the rest of her life.
Sikandar, being a thorough gentleman and a nice person, is happy with this small consolation too, and does not impose himself upon her as a husband. Suraiya is married off under the stewardship of her Bhaabhi, i.e., Zeenat, the highly respected Bahu Begum of the house. But the story gets another twist when Yusuf returns from outstation and learns that he has become a victim of his maternal uncle's conspiracy against him. Deeply hurt to know that his sweetheart has been married to another person but not able to accept the reality, he approaches Zeenat at the house of Sikandar Mirza. Zeenat tells him that though her marriage was not thoroughly executed and therefore she is unmarried in the eyes of the law and the religion, yet he should forget her as she will never compromise with the honour of Sikandar for the sake of her own pleasure. Their talks are overheard by Sikandar and then he makes a great sacrifice (by setting his mansion on fire and dying in it while making it look like that Zeenat died in it as well) to unite the lovers and ensure that they live happily together without the world's knowing the truth."

In August 1947, after India sought independence from the British, the Last Viceroy of India, Mountbatten gave Cyril Radcliffe, the responsibility of dividing India into two parts – India and Pakistan. Radcliffe drew two lines – one in Punjab and another one in Bengal. This line was known as the Radcliffe Line.
Begum Jaan (Vidya Balan) is a prostitute who runs a brothel between the cities of Shakargarh and Dorangla. The prostitutes in Begum Jaan's brothel are a number of girls she raised herself, who were either abandoned or disowned by their families and now work for her. The members of the brothel include an elderly woman known as Amma (Ila Arun), Sujeet (Pitobash Tripathy), a local worker who brings her customers and Salim (Sumit Nijhawan), a gunman who guards them and also two dogs. They are pestered by government officers Hari Prasad (Ashish Vidyarthi), Ilyas Khan (Rajit Kapoor) and Inspector Shyam Singh (Rajesh Sharma) who visit her and ask all of the residents to evict the brothel, as it lies on the land that the Radcliffe Line is to pass through. Love is shown to blossom between Sujeet and Rubina (Gauahar Khan). Begum Jaan's brothel is looked after by Raja Sahib (Naseeruddin Shah), under whose protection, they are safe and sound. He pays their taxes and duties. Begum Jaan sends message to him for his help in this matter. He arrives at the brothel with gifts and presents for them and after hearing about their plight, he assures them of help by stating that he would be going to Delhi soon and discuss the matter there. However, he demands to spend the night with young Shabnam (Mishti Chakraborty), who had recently joined the brothel as a mental wreck after abuse. Begum Jaan reluctantly forces Shabnam to sleep with Raja Sahib while she sings in the sidelines as he enjoys his night.
After several failed attempts to convince Begum Jaan and her team to leave despite giving them a month's notice, as a last resort, Hari and Ilyas, enlist the help of Kabir (Chunky Pandey), an infamous killer in Sonapur, to threaten Begum with her members to vacate the brothel. Raja Sahib returns to the brothel one day to inform Begum Jaan that his efforts to save her brothel have failed and now she must vacate the brothel. Begum, who was having hopes from Raja Sahib is shocked in dismay. Still, she stubbornly tells Raja Sahib come what may, she'll rather die in her house like a queen than die on the streets like a beggar. Kabir proceeds to kill Begum's beloved dogs, even feeding their meat to Begum and her girls. He then kills Sujeet while he is returning from the market with a few other girls of the brothel. He persuades the girls to escape while sacrificing his life. This killing enrages Begum Jaan and her members further. As a result of Kabir's intimidation tactics, Begum asks Salim to train every one of her girls to use weapons and fight back. Intensive training practice sessions are held.
Meanwhile, Masterji (Vivek Mushran), Laadli's teacher, is in love with Begum Jaan and proposes to her, unaware that another prostitute named Gulabo (Pallavi Sharda), harbors feelings for him as well. Begum Jaan rejects his proposal and asks him to leave, leading an irate Master to concoct a plan to kill her. He convinces Gulabo to run away from the brothel, betraying Begum Jaan. Gulabo does so but Masterji spurns her and gets her raped by his accomplices inside a horse carriage. She vows vengeance.
That same night, Kabir and his men attack the brothel. Laadli her mother and shabnam are forced to run away and are attacked by the policeman Shyam Singh, who seeks benefit from them, but laadli undresses herself which reminds him his ten years old daughter and he cries and asks her to stop. Begum and the girls fight back but to no avail. Gulabo returns and later slits Masterji's throat, while he is witnessing the attack on the brothel by Kabir and his goons. However, she has been badly assaulted by Masterji's accomplices and dies. The goons throw lighted torches inside the brothel, causing the building to be engulfed in flames. Begum Jaan and her girls put up a determined fight. Many are killed. She and her four surviving members smile while looking at their home being set ablaze; they walk inside the building and shut the doors. They burn to death as Amma narrates the story of Rani Padmavati of Chittorgarh, who refused to fall into the hands of the enemy and instead martyred herself and died a valiant death, just like the plight of Begum Jaan.
As the movie ends, Ilyas and Hari are seen to be remorseful of their actions; Ilyas shoots himself and we are shown the remains of the brothel and the end to the Begum Jaan legacy."

Biswanath finally gives up all hopes of Arati ever recognising him as her husband, but continues to take care of her.
Parallel to Biswanath & Arati's story, the film shows the story of their children & their spouses. Barin (who was his father's assistant in his publishing house in Belaseshe) is now a successful businessman who runs his own publishing house in Kolkata. He had been apprehensive about Sharmistha (who was portrayed as a middle-scale cloth merchant) outshining him professionally. This has now culminated in Sharmistha divorcing Barin. Sharmistha has shifted to Mumbai with her son & daughter, where she runs a large boutique frequented by big names of Bollywood, and is considering marrying her colleague Kunal Bharadwaj. Arati doesn't remember Barin's divorce, and keeps asking him about Sharmistha. In an attempt to help Arati recover her memories, Barin personally requests Sharmistha to visit Arati. Sharmistha initially declines but later she visits Barin & his family at Shantiniketan after they had returned from Faridpur. Here, Barin apologies to Sharmistha for not allowing her to work freely during their married life & accepts her to be more talented than him. As a result, love is rekindled between them & Sharmistha refuses to go back to Mumbai.
Bijon & Malasree haven't produced children in spite of being apparently happily married for many years. Malasree is pressured by her family to consult a doctor, but refuses. Later she reveals to Biswanath that Bijon is gay, was forced by his family to marry her for the sake of appearance. Biswanath urges Malasree to divorce Bijon, but she retorts that Biswanath himself has proved by his dedication to the now intellectually-disabled Arati that married life isn't centred exclusively around children. She states that both she & Bijon had tried to end the marriage by indulging in extra-marital affairs but failed to do so because they found solace in each other's companionship. Malasree believes that their friendship transcends physical desire, and Bijon would prove to be as faithful and devoted as Biswanath if she ever became like Arati.Palash has abandoned his position as a director in Bollywood, and works as a TV actor in Mumbai. Piu, too, left the film industry to work as a designer, but then stopped working because she wants to bear children and enjoy motherhood. However, their attempts in this regard have not yet borne fruit, and Palash has become too busy with his work to devote time to Piu. Piu was becoming frustrated with her married life, but when she finds Biswanath regretful for not having spent enough time with Arati, she decides not to repeat the same mistake with Palash. It turns out that Palash is stressed by severe competition among small actors to remain relevant in the television industry, and is suffering from oligospermia. He is initially reluctant to accompany Piu to Shantiniketan, but is eventually persuaded by Arati's repeated insistence to see him. At Shantiniketan he is able to reconnect with Piu. On the eve of the family's departure for Faridpur, Palash takes the monumental decision to pull out of the television industry and spend more time with his wife. On the day when Arati's marriage to Biswanath is re-enacted by her family, Piu reveals to Palash that she is finally pregnant with his child."

He gets hold of the fertile land on the banks of the river and builds a house for his son Ayyu.
A few days later, Bhootayya falls ill and eventually dies. The villagers rejoice at the death of Bhootayya and they hold such a grudge against the zamindar that nobody comes to even see his dead body. His son Ayyu tries to get some people to him in completing the funeral rites and offers a huge sum but nobody relents and Ayyu cremates Bhootayya by carrying him to the cremation ground all alone.
The villagers remain wary of Ayyu, and the most rebellious among them was Gulla. He is very outspoken and tries to restrict Ayyu from being mean and merciless towards the villagers like Bhootayya. Gulla's father had way back given a surety to Bhootayya for somebody else's debt and was unable to repay the money. Ayyu promptly goes with his men to confiscate Gulla's house. In an ensuing argument, Gulla smacks Ayyu.

Thus, begins a prolonged enmity between Gulla and Ayyu and both swear to kill each other. Gulla also hires a lawyer to teach Ayyu a lesson and starts spending all his property on the court case. When Gulla swears to kill Ayyu, Gulla's wife goes to Ayyu to warn him and also ask him to forgive her husband. But, Ayyu behaves ruthlessly with her and swears to kill Gulla.
Ayyu's wife reminds him about his father's attitude towards the villagers and their reaction when Bhootayya died. This makes Ayyu give a thought about his behaviour. Gulla's wife tries to kill herself by drowning herself in the river as she gets convinced that Ayyu will not spare her husband. Ayyu sees a woman drowning and being a distinguished swimmer saves her only to find that she is his enemy's wife. This incident has a lasting effect on Ayyu, who tries to end the feud. Ayyu clears all of Gulla's debts and he asks Gulla to work for him to pay off the debts. Gulla agrees and works sincerely to pay off the debts, but resents Ayyu's friendship.
During the village festival, the villagers plot to ransack Ayyu's house and the person who leads the pack is Gulla. They attack Ayyu's house at midnight, and set his house on fire. Ayyu, who is a changed person now, simply states this as an accident when the district police come to investigate the case. This incident begins to make an impact on the villagers to change their perceptions about Ayyu.
With his house burned down, Ayyu goes with his family to live in the house by the river. One day Ayyu goes to the town, leaving behind his family. The village is in flood and Ayyu's house is in danger. Ayyu's wife and kids try to come out of the house as the dam collapses and the water enters the house, flooding it completely. Gulla takes a raft and single-handedly sets out to rescue Ayyu's family. With much difficulty, he saves Ayyu's family and brings them to safety. Ayyu reaches the village and is shocked to see the plight of the village. But he is relieved to see that Gulla has rescued them.

One night, Sarita wakes up to drink water and she hears loud noises in the same pipe. She goes to check and starts to open and clean up the dirty water. To her surprise, she finds those hidden stuffed bags containing cash. She is astounded and after verifying the validity of the cash at her bank, she uses that cash to pay off Sushant's debt and indulge in buying high-end items for her home. Upon Sushant's inquiry, she responds that she has extra cash from her mother's fixed deposit.
Amidst this, episodes of the struggles of her neighbors and continued acrimony between them is shown. In particular, she shares a friendly yet stressful relationship with her neighbor downstairs, whom she adoringly calls Tai (meaning sister in Marathi). With nightly rituals of waking up and un-choking her kitchen pipeline, she continues to benefit from the new source of endless cash and uses it to indulge herself. However, all this free money ends abruptly, when she learns that Prime Minister Modi has introduced demonetization with banning notes of Rs. 500 and 1000. She and her neighbor Tai are distraught as Tai is preparing for her daughter's wedding and Sarita finds her free money ending, putting her back in the same struggle filled life that seemed to resolve with new money.

Unfortunately for Sarita - her cash gathering comes to an abrupt end when thieves hold bank employees at gunpoint and steal all the money, including the cash that Sarita kept with her in her purse. She returns home saddened and dismayed that she loses at the most important moments in her life - during the reality singing show and now with this cash that gave her hope.

Unknown to her, the police are engaging in a criminal investigation into large sums of Rs. 2000 denomination notes haven been given to a local politician who extracted that from a corrupt bank officer in a different city.

However, Sushant intervenes and tells the police about the ziplock bagged money. During this revelation, the Pillai's neighbor deduce that the large bags being brought in their building were indeed by an assistant of the local politician that were actually newly minted money.
